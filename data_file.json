Among its science tools are a seismometer for detecting quakes, sensors for gauging wind and air pressure, a magnetometer, and a heat flow probe designed to take the planet's temperature.</p>\n\n<p>While the team continues to work on <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/news/8612/mars-insight-lander-to-push-on-top-of-the-mole/?site=insight\">getting the probe into the Martian surface</a> as intended, the ultra-sensitive seismometer, called the Seismic Experiment for Interior Structure (<a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/insight/mission/instruments/seis/\">SEIS</a>), has enabled scientists to \"hear\" multiple trembling events from hundreds to thousands of miles away.</p>\n\n<p>Seismic waves are affected by the materials they move through, giving scientists a way to study the composition of the planet's inner structure. Mars can help the team better understand how all rocky planets, including Earth, first formed.</p>\n\n<p><b>Underground</b></p>\n\n<p>Mars trembles more often &mdash; but also more mildly &mdash; than expected. SEIS has found more than 450 seismic signals to date, the vast majority of which are probably quakes (as opposed to data noise created by environmental factors, like wind). The largest quake was about magnitude 4.0 in size &mdash; not quite large enough to travel down below the crust into the planet's lower mantle and core. Those are \"the juiciest parts of the apple\" when it comes to studying the planet's inner structure, said Bruce Banerdt, InSight principal investigator at JPL.</p>\n\n<p>Scientists are ready for more: It took months after InSight's landing in November 2018 before they recorded the first seismic event. By the end of 2019, SEIS was detecting about two seismic signals a day, suggesting that InSight just happened to touch down at a particularly quiet time. Scientists still have their fingers crossed for \"the Big One.\"</p>\n\n<div class='column-width image_module' style=''>\n<figure class='inline_figure'>\n<a class='inline_image_enlarge fancybox' href='/system/resources/detail_files/24784_pia23182-InSight-landslide-web.jpg'>\n<img alt=\"Landslides in Mars' Cerberus Fossae\" src='/system/resources/detail_files/24784_pia23182-InSight-landslide-web.jpg'>\n<div class='enlarge_icon'></div>\n</a>\n<figcaption>\n<b>Landslides in Mars' Cerberus Fossae</b>: The two largest quakes detected by NASA's InSight appear to have originated in a region of Mars called Cerberus Fossae.

A pair of quakes was strongly linked to one such region, Cerberus Fossae, where scientists see boulders that may have been shaken down cliffsides. Ancient floods there <a href=\"/resources/24785\">carved channels</a> nearly 800 miles (1,300 kilometers) long. Lava flows then seeped into those channels within the past 10 million years &mdash; the blink of an eye in geologic time.</p>\n\n<p>Some of these young lava flows show signs of having been fractured by quakes less than 2 million years ago. \"It's just about the youngest tectonic feature on the planet,\" said planetary geologist Matt Golombek of JPL. \"The fact that we're seeing evidence of shaking in this region isn't a surprise, but it's very cool.\"</p>\n\n<p><b>At the Surface</b></p>\n\n<p>Billions of years ago, Mars had a magnetic field. It is no longer present, but it left ghosts behind, magnetizing ancient rocks that are now between 200 feet (61 meters) to several miles below ground. InSight is equipped with a magnetometer &mdash; the first on the surface of Mars to detect magnetic signals.</p>\n\n<p>The magnetometer has found that the signals at Homestead hollow are 10 times stronger than what was predicted based on data from orbiting spacecraft that study the area. The measurements of these orbiters are averaged over a couple of hundred miles, whereas InSight's measurements are more local.</p>\n\n<p>Because most surface rocks at InSight's location are too young to have been magnetized by the planet's former field, \"this magnetism must be coming from ancient rocks underground,\" said Catherine Johnson, a planetary scientist at the University of British Columbia and the Planetary Science Institute. \"We're combining these data with what we know from seismology and geology to understand the magnetized layers below InSight. How strong or deep would they have to be for us to detect this field?\"</p>\n\n<p>In addition, scientists are intrigued by how these signals change over time. The measurements vary by day and night; they also tend to pulse around midnight. Theories are still being formed as to what causes such changes, but one possibility is that they're related to the solar wind interacting with the Martian atmosphere.</p>\n\n<p><b>In the Wind</b></p>\n\n<p>InSight measures wind speed, direction and air pressure nearly continuously, offering more data than previous landed missions. The spacecraft's <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/insight/weather/\">weather sensors</a> have detected thousands of passing whirlwinds, which are called dust devils when they pick up grit and become visible. \"This site has more whirlwinds than any other place we've landed on Mars while carrying weather sensors,\" said Aymeric Spiga, an atmospheric scientist at Sorbonne University in Paris.</p>\n\n<p>Despite all that activity and frequent imaging, InSight's cameras have yet to see dust devils. But SEIS can feel these whirlwinds pulling on the surface like a giant vacuum cleaner. \"Whirlwinds are perfect for subsurface seismic exploration,\" said Philippe Lognonn&eacute; of Institut de Physique du Globe de Paris (IPGP), principal investigator of SEIS.</p>\n\n<p><b>Still to Come: The Core</b></p>\n\n<p>InSight has two radios: one for regularly sending and receiving data, and a more powerful radio designed to measure the \"wobble\" of Mars as it spins. This X-band radio, also known as the Rotation and Interior Structure Experiment (RISE), can eventually reveal whether the planet's core is solid or liquid. A solid core would cause Mars to wobble less than a liquid one would.</p>\n\n<p>This first year of data is just a start. Watching over a full Martian year (two Earth years) will give scientists a much better idea of the size and speed of the planet's wobble.</p>\n\n<p><b>About InSight</b></p>\n\n<p>A division of Caltech in Pasadena, JPL manages InSight for NASA's Science Mission Directorate.

The mission team plans to command the scoop on InSight's robotic arm to press down on the \"mole,\" the mini pile driver designed to hammer itself as much as 16 feet (5 meters) down. They hope that pushing down on the mole's top, also called the back cap, will keep it from <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/news/8529/insights-mole-team-peers-into-the-pit/?site=insight\">backing out of its hole on Mars</a>, as it did twice in recent months after nearly burying itself.</p>\n\n<p>Part of an instrument called the Heat Flow and Physical Properties Package, or <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/insight/mission/instruments/hp3/\">HP<sup>3</sup></a>, the mole is a 16-inch-long (40-centimeter-long) spike equipped with an internal hammering mechanism. While burrowing into the soil, it is designed to drag with it a ribbonlike tether that extends from the spacecraft.

HP<sup>3 </sup>was provided to NASA by the German Aerospace Center, or DLR.</p>\n\n<p>The team has avoided pushing on the back cap until now to avoid any potential damage to the tether.</p>\n\n<p><div class='column-width image_module' style=''>\n<figure class='inline_figure'>\n<a class='inline_image_enlarge fancybox' href='/system/resources/detail_files/24780_PIA23619-16.jpg'>\n<img alt=\"Robotic Arm Pushes on a Model of the 'Mole'\" src='/system/resources/detail_files/24780_PIA23619-16.jpg'>\n<div class='enlarge_icon'></div>\n</a>\n<figcaption>\n<b>Robotic Arm Pushes on a Model of the 'Mole'</b>: This test using an engineering model of the InSight lander here on Earth shows how the spacecraft on Mars will use its robotic arm to press on a digging device, called the \"mole.\" Credits: NASA/JPL-Caltech. <a href=\"/resources/24780/robotic-arm-pushes-on-a-model-of-the-mole/?site=insight\">Full image and caption &rsaquo;</a>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>The mole <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/news/8444/common-questions-about-insights-mole/?site=insight\">found itself stuck on Feb. 28, 2019</a>, the first day of hammering. The InSight team has since determined that the soil here is different than what has been encountered on other parts of Mars. InSight landed in an area with an unusually thick duricrust, or a layer of cemented soil. Rather than being loose and sandlike, as expected, the dirt granules stick together.</p>\n\n<p>The mole needs friction from soil in order to travel downward; without it, recoil from its self-hammering action causes it to simply bounce in place. Ironically, loose soil, not duricrust, provides that friction as it falls around the mole.</p>\n\n<p>This past summer, the InSight team started using the robotic arm's scoop to press on the side of the mole, a technique called \"pinning\" that added just enough friction to help it dig without coming in contact with the fragile science tether connected to the mole's back cap.   </p>\n\n<p>While pinning helped, the mole popped back out of the Martian soil on two occasions, possibly from soil building up from beneath. With few alternatives left, the team has decided to try helping the mole dig by carefully pressing on its back cap while attempting to avoid the tether.</p>\n\n<p>It might take several tries to perfect the back-cap push, just as pinning did. Throughout late February and early March, InSight's arm will be maneuvered into position so that the team can test what happens as the mole briefly hammers.</p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, the team is also considering using the scoop to move more soil into the hole that has formed around the mole. This could add more pressure and friction, allowing it to finally dig down. Whether they pursue this route depends on how deep the mole is able to travel after the back-cap push.</p>\n\n<p><b>About InSight</b></p>\n\n<p>JPL manages InSight for NASA's Science Mission Directorate.

During the hiatus, other orbiters will relay data from the Mars Curiosity rover and Mars InSight lander to Earth.</p>\n\n<p>The maintenance work involves updating battery parameters in the spacecraft's flash memory - a rare step that's been done <a href=\"/news/1867/mission-nearing-decade-at-mars-finishes-memory-update/\">only twice before</a> in the orbiter's 15 years of flight. This special update is necessary because it was recently determined that the battery parameters in flash were out of date and if used, would not charge MRO's batteries to the desired levels.</p>\n\n<p>In addition to the battery parameters, engineers will use this opportunity to update planetary position tables that also reside in flash. The spacecraft will go into a precautionary standby mode, called safe mode, three times over the course of the update. It will also swap from its primary computer, called its Side-A computer, to its redundant one, called Side-B.</p>\n\n<p>Mars Reconnaisance Orbiter launched in 2005 and arrived at the Red Planet on March 10, 2006. Since then, the spacecraft has returned 371 terabits of data. Long-lived spacecraft need to guard against failures of aging hardware and the effects of the harsh space environment, such as damage from cosmic rays.</p>\n\n<p>Whenever a spacecraft detects a technical issue, there's a series of actions it can take, including swapping to a redundant side of its electronics or rebooting its computer. Success in those cases depends upon restoring an uncorrupted, up-to-date version of an operating system with its parameter files from flash memory. To guard against corruption of the flash memory itself, multiple copies of essential parameters are stored onboard.</p>\n\n<p>To keep both of the redundant computers up to date, engineers will update the flash on the Side-A computer first and then command a Side-A reboot to ensure that the flash memory was properly updated. Once they confirm the changes have taken effect, they'll swap to Side-B and repeat the process. </p>\n\n<p>After validation of the memory updates, MRO will return to its science and relay-support activities.

Part of the Deep Space Network (DSN), the 112-foot-wide (34-meter-wide) antenna dish being built represents a future in which more missions will require advanced technology, such as lasers capable of transmitting vast amounts of data from astronauts on the Martian surface. As part of its <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/artemisprogram\">Artemis program</a> NASA will send the first woman and next man to the Moon by 2024, applying lessons learned there to send astronauts to Mars.</p>\n\n<p>Using massive antenna dishes, the agency talks to more than 30 deep space missions on any given day, including many international missions. As more missions have launched and with more in the works, NASA is looking to strengthen the network. When completed in 2&frac12; years, the new dish will be christened Deep Space Station-23 (DSS-23), bringing the DSN's number of operational antennas to 13.</p>\n\n<p>\"Since the 1960s, when the world first watched live pictures of humans in space and on the Moon, to revealing imagery and scientific data from the surface of Mars and vast, distant galaxies, the Deep Space Network has connected humankind with our solar system and beyond,\" said Badri Younes, NASA's deputy associate administrator for Space Communications and Navigation, or SCaN, which oversees NASA's networks. \"This new antenna, the fifth of six currently planned, is another example of NASA's determination to enable science and space exploration through the use of the latest technology.\"</p>\n\n<p>Managed by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, the world's largest and busiest deep space network is clustered in three locations - Goldstone, California; Madrid, Spain; and Canberra, Australia - that are positioned approximately 120 degrees apart around the globe to enable continual contact with spacecraft as the Earth rotates. (<a href=\"https://eyes.nasa.gov/dsn/\" target=\"_blank\">This live tool</a> lets viewers see which DSN dishes are sending up commands or receiving data at any given time.)</p>\n\n<p>The first addition to Goldstone since 2003, the new dish is being built at the complex's Apollo site, so named because its DSS-16 antenna supported NASA's human missions to the Moon. Similar antennas have been built in recent years in Canberra, while two are under construction in Madrid.</p>\n\n<p>\"The DSN is Earth's one phone line to our two Voyager spacecraft - both in interstellar space - all our Mars missions and the New Horizons spacecraft that is now far past Pluto,\" said JPL Deputy Director Larry James. \"The more we explore, the more antennas we need to talk to all our missions.\"</p>\n\n<p>While DSS-23 will function as a radio antenna, it will also be equipped with mirrors and a special receiver for lasers beamed from distant spacecraft. This technology is critical for sending astronauts to places like Mars. Humans there will need to communicate with Earth more than NASA's robotic explorers do, and a Mars base, with its life support systems and equipment, would buzz with data that needs to be monitored.</p>\n\n<p>\"Lasers can increase your data rate from Mars by about 10 times what you get from radio,\" said Suzanne Dodd, director of the Interplanetary Network, the organization that manages the DSN. \"Our hope is that providing a platform for optical communications will encourage other space explorers to experiment with lasers on future missions.\"</p>\n\n<p>While clouds can disrupt lasers, Goldstone's clear desert skies make it an ideal location to serve as a laser receiver about 60% of the time. A demonstration of DSS-23's capabilities is around the corner: When NASA launches an orbiter called Psyche to a metallic asteroid in a few years, it will carry an experimental laser communications terminal developed by JPL. Called the Deep Space Optical Communications project, this equipment will send data and images to an observatory at Southern California's Palomar Mountain. But Psyche will also be able to communicate with the new Goldstone antenna, paving the way for higher data rates in deep space.</p>\n\n<p>For more information:</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><a href=\"https://deepspace.jpl.nasa.gov/\"><b>https://deepspace.jpl.nasa.gov/</b></a></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/directorates/heo/scan/index.html\"><b>https://www.nasa.gov/directorates/heo/scan/index.html</b></a></p>\n\n<p>Andrew Good<br />\nJet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif.<br />\n818-393-2433<br />\n<a href=\"mailto:andrew.c.good@jpl.nasa.gov\">andrew.c.good@jpl.nasa.gov</a></p>\n\n<p>Kathryn Hambleton<br />\nNASA Headquarters, Washington<br />\n202-358-1100<br />\n<a href=\"mailto:kathryn.hambleton@nasa.gov\">kathryn.hambleton@nasa.gov</a></p>\n", "thumb": "/system/news_items/list_view_images/8606_list_image.jpg", "main_image": "/assets/public/missing.png", "status": 1}, {"id": 8603, "title": "NASA Administrator Statement on Moon to Mars Initiative, FY 2021 Budget", "target": "_self", "main_image_alt": "NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine delivers the State of NASA address", "meta_author": "", "byline": "", "meta_keywords": "MSR, Mars, future, budget, sample return", "item_name": "", "updated_at": "2020-02-11T01:04:07.328Z", "url": "/news/8603/nasa-administrator-statement-on-moon-to-mars-initiative-fy-2021-budget/", "missions": [[175, "mep", "Mars Exploration Program"]], "news_type": [[19, "press", "Press Releases"]], "description": "Jim Bridenstine addresses NASA's ambitious plans for the coming years, including Mars Sample Return.", "date": "February 10, 2020", "body": "<p>\"President Donald Trump's Fiscal Year 2021 budget for NASA is worthy of 21st century exploration and discovery. The President's budget invests more than $25 billion in NASA to fortify our innovative human space exploration program while maintaining strong support for our agency's full suite of science, aeronautics and technology work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"The budget proposed represents a 12% increase and makes this one of the strongest budgets in NASA history. The reinforced support from the President comes at a critical time as we lay the foundations for landing the first woman and the next man on the South Pole of the Moon by 2024. This budget keeps us firmly on that path.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"We are preparing to achieve pivotal milestones this year in development of the Space Launch System rocket, Orion spacecraft and the Gateway. These make up the backbone of our Artemis program and are fully supported by this budget. They constitute our ability to build a sustainable lunar presence and eventually send human missions to Mars.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"Most noteworthy, is the President's direct funding of more than $3 billion for the development of a human landing system. This is the first time we have had direct funding for a human lander since the Apollo Program. We are serious about our 2024 goals, and the President's budget supports our efforts to get the job done.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"We soon will launch American astronauts on American rockets from American soil for the first time in nearly a decade. This recaptured ability will not only allow us to do more science and more exploration than ever before, but will also broaden commercial activity in low-Earth orbit to support ever greater private partnerships.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"As we prepare to celebrate 20 years of continuous human presence aboard the International Space Station this year, we will continue to look for ways to partner with private enterprise and give more people access to the unique environment microgravity offers. Similarly, when we go to the Moon in the next four years, we are interested in taking the world with us. This includes those involved in our Commercial Lunar Payload Services initiative and the international relationships we have forged over the decades.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"The FY 2021 budget positions NASA to spearhead a new era of human space exploration without focusing funds on one program at the expense of others. This all-of-NASA approach to the future will help us take advantage of all the exciting, new horizons emerging in science, aeronautics and technology.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"The decadal survey priorities are strongly supported by this budget, including history's first <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PVjj0PEPMA&list=PLTiv_XWHnOZpzQKYC6nLf6M9AuBbng_O8\" target=\"_blank\">Mars sample return mission</a>, the Europa Clipper and development of a host of new trailblazing Earth observation missions. In aeronautics, the budget backs all our cutting-edge research on commercial use of supersonic aircraft, all-electric airplanes and development of an unmanned aerial system that will make flying small drones safer and more efficient in the 21st century.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"NASA is on the cusp of embarking on era-defining exploration. The civilization-changing technology we develop will deepen humanity's scientific knowledge of the universe and how to take care of our ever-changing world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"I am confident the FY 2021 budget's proper investment in our agency's priorities, coupled with your unmatched talents and expertise, will strengthen our national posture for continued space preeminence and, as President Trump said during his State of the Union speech last week, help our nation embrace the next frontier.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To learn more about NASA's Fiscal Year 2021 budget, visit:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/budget\" target=\"_blank\"><b>https://www.nasa.gov/budget</b></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Bettina Incl&aacute;n / Matthew Rydin</span><br />\r\n<span>Headquarters, Washington</span><br />\r\n<span><a href=\"tel:202-358-1600\">202-358-1600</a> / <a href=\"tel:202-603-7522\">202-603-7522</a></span><br />\r\n<a href=\"mailto:bettina.inclan@nasa.gov\">bettina.inclan@nasa.gov</a><span> / </span><a href=\"mailto:matthew.m.rydin@nasa.gov\">matthew.m.rydin@nasa.gov</a></p>\r\n", "thumb": "/system/news_items/list_view_images/8603_list_image.jpg", "main_image": "/system/news_items/main_images/8603_8BA7C5ED-73CD-4D0D-9230-74282992F69C.jpeg", "status": 1}, {"id": 8601, "title": "All About the Laser (and Microphone) Atop Mars 2020, NASA's Next Rover", "target": "_self", "main_image_alt": "Mars 2020's mast, or \"head,\" includes a laser instrument called SuperCam that can vaporize rock material and study the resulting plasma.

It will also enable them to analyze a target before deciding whether to guide the rover there for further analysis. Of particular interest: minerals that formed in the presence of liquid water, like clays, carbonates and sulfates. Liquid water is essential to the existence of life as we know it, including microbes, which could have survived on Mars billions of years ago.</p>\n\n<p>Scientists can also use the information from SuperCam to help decide whether to capture rock cores for the rover's sample caching system. Mars 2020 will collect these core samples in metal tubes, eventually depositing them at a predetermined location for a future mission to retrieve and bring back to Earth.</p>\n\n<figure class='column-width embedded_video video_player_container'>\n<div class='video_wrapper'>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/-rvWXCts420\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div>\n<figcaption>\n<b>SuperCam's Laser Zaps</b>: NASA's Mars 2020 will include a laser instrument, called SuperCam, capable of vaporizing rock material and studying its composition. In a test shown here, the SuperCam Mast Unit &mdash; which sits in the mast, or \"head,\" of the rover &mdash; zaps marks across a piece of metal. The popping sound of each laser zap will be recorded on Mars by a microphone installed along with SuperCam. Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n<p><b>Laser Focus</b></p>\n\n<p>SuperCam is essentially a next-generation version of the <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/msl/home/\">Curiosity</a> rover's ChemCam. Like its predecessor, SuperCam can use an infrared laser beam to heat the material it impacts to around 18,000 degrees Fahrenheit (10,000 degrees Celsius) &mdash; a method called laser induced breakdown spectroscopy, or LIBS &mdash; and vaporizes it. A special camera can then determine the chemical makeup of these rocks from the plasma that is created.</p>\n\n<p>Just like ChemCam, SuperCam will use <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/news/2885/laser-targeting-ai-yields-more-mars-science/?site=msl\">artificial intelligence</a> to seek out rock targets worth zapping during and after drives, when humans are out of the loop. In addition, this upgraded A.I. lets SuperCam point very precisely at small rock features.</p>\n\n<p>Another new feature in SuperCam is a green laser that can determine the molecular composition of surface materials. This green beam excites the chemical bonds in a sample and produces a signal depending on which elements are bonded together &mdash; a technique called Raman spectroscopy. SuperCam also uses the green laser to cause some minerals and carbon-based chemicals to emit light, or fluoresce.</p>\n\n<p>Minerals and organic chemicals fluoresce at different rates, so SuperCam's light sensor features a shutter that can close as quickly as 100 nanoseconds at a time &mdash; so fast that very few photons of light will enter it. Altering the shutter speed (a technique called time-resolved luminescence spectroscopy) will enable scientists to better determine the compounds present.</p>\n\n<p>Moreover, SuperCam can use visible and infrared (VISIR) light reflected from the Sun to study the mineral content of rocks and sediments. This VISIR technique complements the Raman spectroscopy; each technique is sensitive to different types of minerals.</p>\n\n<div class='column-width image_module' style=''>\n<figure class='inline_figure'>\n<a href='/resources/24758/supercams-mast-unit-being-tested-at-los-alamos-national-laboratory/' target='_self'>\n<img alt=\"SuperCam's Mast Unit Being Tested at Los Alamos National Laboratory\" src='/system/resources/detail_files/24758_PIA23620-web.jpg'>\n</a>\n<figcaption>\n<b>SuperCam's Mast Unit Being Tested</b>: The Mast Unit for Mars 2020's SuperCam, shown being tested here, will use a laser to vaporize and study rock material on the Red Planet's surface.

The popping sound created by the laser subtly changes depending on a rock's material properties.</p>\n\n<p>\"The microphone serves a practical purpose by telling us something about our rock targets from a distance. But we can also use it to directly record the sound of the Martian landscape or the rover's mast swiveling,\" said Sylvestre Maurice of the Institute for Research in Astrophysics and Planetary Science in Toulouse, France.</p>\n\n<p>The Mars 2020 rover marks the third time this particular microphone design will go to the Red Planet, Maurice said. In the late 1990s, the same design rode aboard the Mars Polar Lander, which crashed on the surface. In 2008, the Phoenix mission experienced electronics issues that prevented the microphone from being used.</p>\n\n<p>In the case of Mars 2020, SuperCam doesn't have the only microphone aboard the rover: <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/mission/technology/entry-descent-landing/#EDL-Cameras-Microphone\">an entry, descent and landing microphone</a> will capture all the sounds of the car-sized rover making its way to the surface. It will add audio to full-color video recorded by the rover&rsquo;s cameras, capturing a Mars landing like never before.</p>\n\n<p><b>Teamwork</b></p>\n\n<p>SuperCam is led by Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico, where the instrument's Body Unit was developed. That part of the instrument includes several spectrometers, control electronics and software.</p>\n\n<p>The Mast Unit was developed and built by several laboratories of the CNRS (French research center) and French universities under the contracting authority of CNES (French space agency). Calibration targets on the rover deck are provided by Spain's University of Valladolid.</p>\n\n<p>JPL is building and will manage operations of the Mars 2020 rover for the NASA Science Mission Directorate at the agency's headquarters in Washington.</p>\n\n<p>Read more about Mars 2020:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/\"><b>https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/</b></a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://nasa.gov/mars2020\" target=\"_blank\"><b>http://nasa.gov/mars2020</b></a></p>\n\n<p><b>News Media Contacts</b></p>\n\n<p>Andrew Good<br />\nJet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif.<br />\n818-393-2433<br />\n<a href=\"mailto:andrew.c.good@jpl.nasa.gov\">andrew.c.good@jpl.nasa.gov</a></p>\n\n<p>Josh Handal<br />\nNASA Headquarters, Washington<br />\n202-358-2307<br />\n<a href=\"mailto:joshua.a.handal@nasa.gov\">joshua.a.handal@nasa.gov</a></p>\n", "thumb": "/system/news_items/list_view_images/8601_PIA23316-320x240.jpg", "main_image": "/system/news_items/main_images/8601_PIA23316-web.jpg", "status": 1}, {"id": 8596, "title": "NASA's MAVEN Explores Mars to Understand Radio Interference at Earth", "target": "_self", "main_image_alt": "", "meta_author": "", "byline": "", "meta_keywords": "", "item_name": "", "updated_at": "2020-02-03T16:28:38.000Z", "url": "/news/8596/nasas-maven-explores-mars-to-understand-radio-interference-at-earth/", "missions": [[181, "maven", "MAVEN"], [175, "mep", "Mars Exploration Program"]], "news_type": [[165, "feature", "Feature Stories"]], "description": "NASA\u2019s MAVEN spacecraft has discovered \u201clayers\u201d and \u201crifts\u201d in the electrically charged part of the upper atmosphere of Mars.", "date": "February  3, 2020", "body": "<p>NASA&rsquo;s MAVEN (Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN) spacecraft has discovered &ldquo;layers&rdquo; and &ldquo;rifts&rdquo; in the electrically charged part of the upper atmosphere (the ionosphere) of Mars.

Forming suddenly and lasting for several hours, these layers act like giant mirrors in the sky, causing radio signals from far away to bounce over the horizon where they can interfere with local transmissions, like two people trying to talk over one another. The layers also can cause interference with radio communications by aircraft and shipping, and can blind military radar.</p>\n\n<div class='column-width image_module' style=''>\n<figure class='inline_figure'>\n<a class='inline_image_enlarge fancybox' href='/system/internal_resources/details/original/848_Graphic_illustrating_radio_signals_from_a_remote_station_%28bent_purple_line%29_interfering_with_a_local_station_%28black_tower%29_after_being_reflected_off_a_plasma_layer_in_the_ionosphere..jpeg'>\n<img alt='Graphic illustrating radio signals from a remote station (bent purple line) interfering with a local station (black tower) after being reflected off a plasma layer in the ionosphere.' src='/internal_resources/848'>\n<div class='enlarge_icon'></div>\n</a>\n<figcaption>\nGraphic illustrating radio signals from a remote station (bent purple line) interfering with a local station (black tower) after being reflected off a plasma layer in the ionosphere.<br />\nCredits: NASA Goddard/CI lab\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n\n<p>At Earth, the layers form at an altitude of about 60 miles (approximately 100km) where the air is too thin for an aircraft to fly, but too thick for any satellite to orbit. The only way to reach them is with a rocket, but these missions last only tens of minutes before falling back to Earth. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve known they exist for over 80 years, but we know so little about what goes on inside them, because no satellite can get low enough to reach the layers,&rdquo; says Collinson, &ldquo;at least, no satellite at Earth&rdquo;.</p>\n\n<p>At Mars, spacecraft such as MAVEN can orbit at lower altitudes and can sample these features directly. MAVEN carries several scientific instruments that measure plasmas in the atmosphere and space around Mars. Recent measurements from one of these instruments detected unexpected sudden spikes in the abundance of plasma as it flew through the Martian ionosphere. Joe Grebowsky, former MAVEN project scientist at NASA Goddard, immediately recognized the spike from his previous experience with rocket flights through the layers at Earth. Not only had MAVEN discovered that such layers can occur at other planets than Earth, but the new results reveal that Mars offers what Earth cannot, a place where we can reliably explore these layers with satellites.</p>\n\n<p><div class='column-width image_module' style=''>\n<figure class='inline_figure'>\n<a href='/resources/24756/artists-concept-of-maven-encountering-plasma-layers-at-mars/' target='_self'>\n<img alt='Graphic illustrating the MAVEN spacecraft encountering plasma layers at Mars.' src='/system/resources/detail_files/24756_mavenatmars-web.jpg'>\n</a>\n<figcaption>\nGraphic illustrating the MAVEN spacecraft encountering plasma layers at Mars.<br />\nCredits: NASA Goddard/CI lab<br />\n<a href=\"/resources/24756/artists-concept-of-maven-encountering-plasma-layers-at-mars/\">Download image &rsaquo;</a>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>&ldquo;The low altitudes observable by MAVEN will fill in a great gap in our understanding of this region on both Mars and Earth, with really significant discoveries to be had,&rdquo; says Grebowsky, a co-author on the paper.</p>\n\n<p>MAVEN observations are already overturning many of our existing ideas about the phenomena: MAVEN has discovered that the layers also have a mirror-opposite, a &ldquo;rift&rdquo;, where plasma is less abundant. The existence of such &ldquo;rifts&rdquo; in nature was completely unknown before their discovery at Mars by MAVEN, and overturns existing scientific models which say they cannot form. Additionally, unlike at Earth where the layers are short-lived and unpredictable, the Martian layers are surprisingly long-lived and persistent.</p>\n\n<p>These new discoveries already have given us a better understanding of the fundamental processes that underpin these layers, and future exploration at Mars will allow us to build better scientific models of how they form. While, much like the weather, we cannot stop them from forming, perhaps someday the new insights from Mars may help us to forecast them at Earth, meaning more reliable radio communication for us all.</p>\n\n<p>This research was funded by the MAVEN mission. MAVEN's principal investigator is based at the University of Colorado's Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics, and NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, manages the MAVEN project. Partner institutions include Lockheed Martin, the University of California at Berkeley, and NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

Through the windows of each room's viewing gallery, visitors can watch engineers gowned in white \"bunny suits\" testing Earth-observing satellites and robots built for alien worlds. More than 30,000 members of the public visit High Bay 1 each year, and many also tune in online to <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/mission/where-is-the-rover/\">see the work going on there</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This summer, visitors will be able to see an Earth-science mission called <a href=\"https://nisar.jpl.nasa.gov/\">NISAR</a> being built in High Bay 1. It will be followed by <a href=\"https://europa.nasa.gov/\">Europa Clipper</a>. High Bay 2 will be home to an Earth-science mission called <a href=\"https://swot.jpl.nasa.gov/\">SWOT</a> before a mission to a metal asteroid, <a href=\"https://psyche.asu.edu/\">Psyche</a>, takes its place.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>What's a Clean Room?</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the name implies, a clean room has to be pristine: Dust, hair, oils and other particulates in the air can interfere with electronics and moving parts. All efforts are made to keep bacteria to a minimum as well. Scientists don't want to discover life only to find it was accidentally sent from Earth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"The whole idea of a clean room for spacecraft assembly comes out of the Ranger program,\" Conway said. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>As pathfinders for the Apollo missions that followed, the nine Ranger missions were essentially unarmed missiles fired at the Moon. All but the first two were built in High Bay 1, back when it looked more like an aircraft hangar; engineers even smoked in it. The standards for manufacturing spacecraft were just being established. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sterilizing a spacecraft with heat appeared to fry Ranger 3's electronics, causing it to miss the Moon by 22,000 miles (35,000 kilometers). Debris floating inside Ranger 4 is believed to have led to its failure. Engineers began to realize that specialized clean rooms and cleaning processes were needed to build successful missions.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class='column-width image_module' style=''>\n<figure class='inline_figure'>\n<a href='/resources/24737/mariner-1-in-jpls-spacecraft-assembly-facility/' target='_self'>\n<img alt=\"Mariner 1 in JPL's Spacecraft Assembly Facility\" src='/system/resources/detail_files/24737_PIA23310-16.jpg'>\n</a>\n<figcaption>\n<b>Mariner 1 in JPL's Spacecraft Assembly Facility:</b> JPL's Spacecraft Assembly Facility looks more like a hangar in this photo of two engineers standing with Mariner 1 on May 2, 1962. <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/resources/24737/mariner-1-in-jpls-spacecraft-assembly-facility/\" target=\"_blank\">Full image and caption &rsaquo;</a> \n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>\"When JPL started, we knew more about spacecraft than anybody else &mdash; and we knew nothing,\" said Arden Acord, a systems engineer who began working at JPL in 1971. \"We learned a lot of things along the way.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many of his first coworkers had built <a href=\"https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/jplhistory/early/wartime.php\">the Sergeant and Corporal missiles</a> when JPL was still a U.S. Army lab. Acord was a self-described long-haired hippie working alongside guys with crew cuts: \"It was a tough club to break into for a while. But eventually I became accepted.\" He went on to help build the twin Viking orbiters, which carried the first successful Mars landers, Voyager 1 and 2, and Galileo and Cassini.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Two Rooms for Earth and Beyond</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Almost all the spacecraft Acord worked on were built in High Bay 1, which in 1973 became what's known as a Class 10,000 clean room. That means there are fewer than 10,000 particles of 0.5 microns or larger in size per cubic foot of air volume (0.5 microns is about 200 times smaller than the width of a human hair).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Opened in 1976, High Bay 2 is a Class 10,000 clean room as well. The air in both rooms cycles about 70 times per hour through extensive filtration systems. To keep the workers comfortable, High Bay 2 is kept at 70 degrees, while High Bay 1 is kept at 68 degrees. </p>\r\n\r\n<div class='column-width image_module' style=''>\n<figure class='inline_figure'>\n<a href='/resources/24740/galileo-in-high-bay-1/' target='_blank'>\n<img alt='Galileo in High Bay 1' src='/system/resources/detail_files/24740_PIA23616-16.jpg'>\n</a>\n<figcaption>\n<b>Galileo in High Bay 1: </b>White walls and scaffolding had become a common sight in the High Bay 1 clean room in JPL's Spacecraft Assembly Facility by the time the Galileo orbiter was being built. <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/resources/24740/galileo-in-high-bay-1/\" target=\"_blank\">Full image and caption &rsaquo;</a> \n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Deep space missions tend to be bigger and require more ground equipment, so they typically go in High Bay 1 and involve more gowning for planetary protection purposes. Being the smaller of the pair, High Bay 2 is more suitable for the spacecraft of Earth science missions. The high bays' hangar-door dimensions determine the maximum size of the spacecraft that can be built within.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Keeping It Clean</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of course, filtered air is only part of what makes a clean room clean. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"The level of cleanliness changes depending on the spacecraft you're building,\" said Roger Francis, the building's facility manager. \"If you have special lenses, like a telescope, it requires more effort to make sure particles don't affect your instruments.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But regardless of the type of spacecraft, staff regularly wipe down surfaces with 180-proof isopropyl rubbing alcohol, push microfiber mops across the floors and use HEPA vacuums along wall corners, while the walls themselves are cleaned up to 10 feet (3 meters) high. Most metal is stainless steel, which resists corroding and releasing particles into the air.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then there are the rigorous procedures required for everything that enters the clean room.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p>For spacecraft and their separate components, that means being wrapped in plastic and brought into an airlock outside the clean room. They're unwrapped on the \"dirty side\" of the room and wiped down before being moved to the clean side. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>A crane capable of lifting 30,000 pounds (13,608 kilograms) slides along the ceiling of each room, assisting workers as they move equipment through the high bays. A white parasol on each crane's cable catches any grease or debris from the crane that could land on the sensitive hardware below. </p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Dressing the Part</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>People follow a special process before entering the clean room as well: Automated shoe brushes and sticky mats remove debris from their shoes before they enter a locker room. Once their feet are covered with booties, they step over a line onto the clean side of the room.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then it's time to don a bunny suit, face mask, hair cover and latex gloves before taping sleeves closed. (A mannequin called High Bay Bob stands on the floor of High Bay 1, demonstrating proper attire and giving visitors a sense of scale.) Finally, they step into an \"air shower\" that blows stray particles off the outside of their garments.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class='column-width image_module' style=''>\n<figure class='inline_figure'>\n<a href='/resources/24739/ranger-7-in-safs-high-bay-1/' target='_blank'>\n<img alt='Ranger 7 in High Bay 1 on Dec. 10, 1963' src='/system/resources/detail_files/24739_PIA23520-NASA.jpg'>\n</a>\n<figcaption>\n<b>Ranger 7 in SAF's High Bay 1: </b>High Bay 1 looks more like a modern clean room in this photo of Ranger 7 taken on Dec. 10, 1963, in JPL's Spacecraft Assembly Facility.

As added precautions against static electricity, humidity in the room is kept at about 45% and the concrete floor has a special epoxy coating to bleed static charge that builds up in garments as people move about the room.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>The Wall of Fame</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The mission emblems that line the top of High Bay 1's south wall aren't exempt from the cleanliness requirements. The idea for the placards came about in 2008, when Acord was tasked with preserving the Spacecraft Assembly Facility's history. Representing JPL's biggest missions, the emblems would serve as a testament to engineers' hard work assembling and testing hardware.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Visitors to High Bay 1 may have noticed the south wall is running out of room for additional placards. But there's always more space to explore: Emblems might expand onto the east wall in the future.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>News Media Contacts</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Andrew Good<br />\r\nJet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif.<br />\r\n818-393-2433<br />\r\n<a href=\"mailto:andrew.c.good@jpl.nasa.gov\">andrew.c.good@jpl.nasa.gov</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Alana Johnson<br />\r\nNASA Headquarters, Washington<br />\r\n202-358-1501<br />\r\n<a href=\"mailto:alana.r.johnson@nasa.gov\">alana.r.johnson@nasa.gov</a></p>\r\n", "thumb": "/system/news_items/list_view_images/8575_PIA23519-SAF-unannot-320x240.jpg", "main_image": "/system/news_items/main_images/8575_PIA23519-SAF-annotated_1280wide.jpg", "status": 1}, {"id": 8573, "title": "NASA's Mars 2020 Rover Completes Its First Drive", "target": "_self", "main_image_alt": "In a clean room at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, engineers observed the first driving test for NASA's Mars 2020 rover on Dec. 17, 2019.

Winds drive a series of processes in the atmosphere that can affect the propagation of radio waves, which are crucial for communications purposes for those on the surface, and the prediction of paths satellites will take in their orbit around Earth. Mapping Martian winds, therefore, is a crucial step towards understanding characteristics of extraterrestrial atmospheres beyond what we know about processes on Earth.</p>\n\n<p>Planetary atmospheres aren&rsquo;t static, and they certainly aren&rsquo;t uniform. To categorize where distinctive processes occur, the layers of atmospheres are differentiated based on temperature. For example, humans live in the lowest level: the troposphere. That&rsquo;s where weather happens, and temperature gets cooler at higher altitudes.</p>\n\n<p>The upper atmospheric winds on both Earth and Mars are in the planets&rsquo; respective thermospheres, which are areas where temperature increases with height. The measurements of winds that were recently mapped above Mars were found at an altitude range of about 140-240 kilometers (85-150 miles) above the planet&rsquo;s surface.</p>\n\n<p><b>MAVEN&rsquo;s journey</b></p>\n\n<p>The wind data has been gathered by the Neutral Gas and Ion Mass Spectrometer (NGIMS). NGIMS&rsquo; original purpose was to determine the structure and composition of the Martian atmosphere by measuring in it the amounts of ions (electrically charged particles) and gases. However, although it was not originally designed to do so, in April 2016, the MAVEN team began using NGIMS to observe horizontal winds. Pausing normal collection of data, scientists on Earth programmed the instrument to nod back and forth so that it could detect the direction of winds along its track.</p>\n\n<p>By combining data from many tracks as MAVEN orbits Mars, scientists slowly built up a map of wind behavior. This led to a startling discovery: the wind patterns actually correlated with the Martian topography below.</p>\n\n<p><b>Far above and down below</b></p>\n\n<p>Mars has tall mountains and steep valleys just as Earth does, and winds on the surface are forced above and around this topography. The disturbance of surface winds leads to echoes of these wind patterns in the Martian thermosphere as gravity waves.</p>\n\n<div class='column-width image_module' style=''>\n<figure class='inline_figure'>\n<a href='/resources/24755/artists-concept-of-wind-flowing-over-martian-terrain/' target='_self'>\n<img alt='Conceptual image of wind (blue arrows) flowing over rugged Martian terrain and generating disturbances that propagate upward as atmospheric gravity waves (grey lines).

Since the proton aurora is generated indirectly by hydrogen derived from Martian water that&rsquo;s in the process of being lost to space, this aurora could be used to help track ongoing Martian water loss.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;In this new study using MAVEN/IUVS data from multiple Mars years, the team has found that periods of increased atmospheric escape correspond with increases in proton aurora occurrence and intensity,&rdquo; said Andr&eacute;a Hughes of Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in Daytona Beach, Florida. Hughes is lead author of a <a href=\"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2019JA027140\" target=\"_blank\">paper on this research published December 12 in the Journal of Geophysical Research, Space Physics</a>. &ldquo;Perhaps one day, when interplanetary travel becomes commonplace, travelers arriving at Mars during southern summer will have front-row seats to observe Martian proton aurora majestically dancing across the dayside of the planet (while wearing ultraviolet-sensitive goggles, of course). These travelers will witness firsthand the final stages of Mars losing the remainder of its water to space.&rdquo; Hughes is presenting the research on December 12 at the <a href=\"https://www.agu.org/fall-meeting\" target=\"_blank\">American Geophysical Union meeting</a> in San Francisco. </p>\n\n<p>Different phenomena produce different kinds of aurora. However, all aurora at Earth and Mars are powered by solar activity, whether it be explosions of high-speed particles known as solar storms, eruptions of gas and magnetic fields known as coronal mass ejections, or gusts in the solar wind, a stream of electrically conducting gas that blows continuously into space at around a million miles per hour. For example, the northern and southern lights at Earth happen when violent solar activity disturbs Earth&rsquo;s magnetosphere, causing high velocity electrons to slam into gas particles in Earth&rsquo;s nightside upper atmosphere and make them glow. Similar processes generate Mars&rsquo; discrete and diffuse aurora &ndash; two types of aurora that were previously observed on the Martian nightside.</p>\n\n<div class='column-width image_module' style=''>\n<figure class='inline_figure'>\n<a href='/resources/21966/animation-of-proton-aurora-at-mars/' target='_self'>\n<img alt='This animation shows a proton aurora at Mars.

Credits: Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University/LASP, U. of Colorado\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n\n<p>When the MAVEN team first observed the proton aurora, they thought it was a relatively unusual occurrence. &ldquo;At first, we believed that these events were rather rare because we weren&rsquo;t looking at the right times and places,&rdquo; said Mike Chaffin, research scientist at the University of Colorado Boulder&rsquo;s Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics (LASP) and second author of the study. &ldquo;But after a closer look, we found that proton aurora are occurring far more often in dayside southern summer observations than we initially expected.&rdquo; The team has found proton aurora in about 14 percent of their dayside observations, which increases to more than 80 percent of the time when only dayside southern summer observations are considered. &ldquo;By comparison, IUVS has detected diffuse aurora on Mars in a few percent of orbits with favorable geometry, and discrete aurora detections are rarer still in the dataset,&rdquo; said Nick Schneider, coauthor and lead of the IUVS team at LASP.</p>\n\n<p>The correlation with the southern summer gave a clue as to why proton aurora are so common and how they could be used to track water loss. During southern summer on Mars, the planet is also near its closest distance to the Sun in its orbit and huge dust storms can occur. Summer warming and dust activity appear to cause proton auroras by forcing water vapor high in the atmosphere. Solar extreme ultraviolet light breaks the water into its components, hydrogen and oxygen. The light hydrogen is weakly bound by Mars&rsquo; gravity and enhances the hydrogen corona surrounding Mars, increasing hydrogen loss to space. More hydrogen in the corona makes interactions with solar-wind protons more common, making proton aurora more frequent and brighter.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;All the conditions necessary to create Martian proton aurora (<i>e.g.,</i> solar wind protons, an extended hydrogen atmosphere, and the absence of a global dipole magnetic field) are more commonly available at Mars than those needed to create other types of aurora,&rdquo; said Hughes. &ldquo;Also, the connection between MAVEN&rsquo;s observations of increased atmospheric escape and increases in proton aurora frequency and intensity means that proton aurora can actually be used as a proxy for what&rsquo;s happening in the hydrogen corona surrounding Mars, and therefore, a proxy for times of increased atmospheric escape and water loss.&rdquo; </p>\n\n<p>This research was funded by the MAVEN mission.

These regions near the poles have been studied by NASA's Phoenix lander, which <a href=\"https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=1756\" target=\"_blank\">scraped up ice</a>, and MRO, which has taken many images from space of <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/news/372/mro-sees-ice-on-mars-exposed-by-meteor-impacts/\">meteor impacts that have excavated this ice</a>. To find ice that astronauts could easily dig up, the study's authors relied on two heat-sensitive instruments: MRO's Mars Climate Sounder and the Thermal Emission Imaging System (THEMIS) camera on Mars Odyssey.</p>\n\n<p>Why use heat-sensitive instruments when looking for ice? Buried water ice changes the temperature of the Martian surface. The study's authors cross-referenced temperatures suggestive of ice with other data, such as reservoirs of ice detected by radar or seen after meteor impacts. Data from Odyssey's Gamma Ray Spectrometer, which is tailor-made for mapping water ice deposits, were also useful.</p>\n\n<p>As expected, all these data suggest a trove of water ice throughout the Martian poles and mid-latitudes. But the map reveals particularly shallow deposits that future mission planners may want to study further.</p>\n\n<p><b>Picking a Landing Site</b></p>\n\n<p>While there are lots of places on Mars scientists would like to visit, few would make practical landing sites for astronauts. Most scientists have homed in on the northern and southern mid-latitudes, which have more plentiful sunlight and warmer temperatures than the poles. But there's a heavy preference for landing in the northern hemisphere, which is generally lower in elevation and provides more atmosphere to slow a landing spacecraft.</p>\n\n<p>A large portion of a region called Arcadia Planitia is the most tempting target in the northern hemisphere. The map shows lots of blue and purple in this region, representing water ice less than one foot (30 centimeters) below the surface; warm colors are over two feet (60 centimeters) deep. Sprawling black zones on the map represent areas where a landing spacecraft would sink into fine dust.</p>\n\n<p><b>What's Next?</b></p>\n\n<p>Piqueux is planning a comprehensive campaign to continue studying buried ice across different seasons, watching how the abundance of this resource changes over time.</p>\n\n<p>\"The more we look for near-surface ice, the more we find,\" said MRO Deputy Project Scientist Leslie Tamppari of JPL. \"Observing Mars with multiple spacecraft over the course of years continues to provide us with new ways of discovering this ice.\"</p>\n\n<p>JPL manages the MRO and Mars Odyssey missions for NASA's Science Mission Directorate in Washington.

Next summer, Mars 2020 will be headed for the Red Planet. While the newest rover borrows from Curiosity's design, they aren't twins: Built and managed by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, each has its own role in the ongoing exploration of Mars and the search for ancient life. Here's a closer look at what sets the siblings apart.</p>\n\n<p><b>The Missions</b></p>\n\n<p>Landing in 2004 to \"follow the water,\" the twin rovers Spirit and Opportunity discovered evidence that the planet once hosted running water before becoming a frozen desert. But when did this happen and why?</p>\n\n<p>NASA launched the supersized Curiosity rover to learn more. Since landing in 2012, Curiosity has been roaming Gale Crater, which, it discovered, contained a lake billions of years ago and an environment that could have supported microbial life. The rover is still hunting for clues related to this environment as it ascends the 3-mile-tall (5-kilometer-tall) Mount Sharp, which sits within Gale Crater and was partially formed by water.</p>\n\n<p>Some 3,760 miles (6,050 kilometers) away, Mars 2020 will also explore a landscape shaped by water: Jezero Crater, the site of an ancient delta. But 2020 will take the next scientific step: It will look for actual signs of past life, or biosignatures, capturing samples of rocks and soil that could be retrieved by future missions and returned to Earth for in-depth study.</p>\n\n<p>\u200b<div class='column-width image_module' style=''>\n<figure class='inline_figure'>\n<a class='inline_image_enlarge fancybox' href='/system/resources/detail_files/24716_PIA23516-16.jpg'>\n<img alt=\"Illustration of differences between NASA's Mars 2020 and Curiosity rovers.\" src='/system/resources/detail_files/24716_PIA23516-16.jpg'>\n<div class='enlarge_icon'></div>\n</a>\n<figcaption>\nSome Differences Between Mars 2020 and Curiosity: NASA's Mars 2020 rover looks virtually the same as Curiosity, but there are a number of differences.

It's also heavier, checking in at 2,260 pounds (1,025 kilograms), compared with Curiosity's 1,982 pounds (899 kilograms). The weight difference has to do with the tools each carries.</p>\n\n<p>Start with the robotic arms: Curiosity's extends 7 feet (2.2 meters) and wields a rotating 65-pound (30-kilogram) turret equipped with a scientific camera, chemical analyzer and drill. The roving science lab pulverizes rock samples and pours the powder into its chassis, where two laboratories can determine the rocks' chemical and mineral makeup.</p>\n\n<p>Mars 2020's arm has the same reach as Curiosity's, but its turret weighs more &mdash; 99 pounds (45 kilograms) &mdash; because it carries larger instruments and a larger drill for coring. The drill will cut intact rock cores, rather than pulverizing them, and they'll be placed in sample tubes via a complex storage system.</p>\n\n<p><b>The Eyes and Ears </b></p>\n\n<p>All of NASA's Mars missions have allowed the public to ride along as scientists and engineers explore the planet. Curiosity has been doing that with 17 cameras on its Mast, or head, and body; four of them are color cameras.</p>\n\n<p>Mars 2020 has 23 cameras, most of them color. The new rover also includes \"ears\" &mdash; two microphones to capture not only the first sounds of a Mars landing, but also Martian wind and the rover's chemical-analyzing <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/mission/instruments/supercam/\">laser zaps</a>. <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/mission/instruments/mastcam-z/\">Mastcam-Z</a>, an improved version of Curiosity's Mast Camera, has a zoom capability and will take high-definition video and panoramas.</p>\n\n<p><b>The Wheels</b></p>\n\n<p>Curiosity has prepared Mars 2020's team for \"off-roading\" on the Red Planet. When holes began appearing in the veteran rover's aluminum wheels, engineers realized that sharp rocks cemented on the Martian surface exert more pressure on the wheels than expected. Careful drive planning, along with <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/news/2893/an-algorithm-helps-protect-mars-curiositys-wheels/?site=msl\">a software upgrade</a>, will keep them in shape for the rest of Curiosity's journey up Mount Sharp.</p>\n\n<p>While <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/mission/rover/wheels/\">Mars 2020's wheels</a> are made from the same materials, they're slightly bigger and narrower, with skins that are almost a millimeter thicker. Instead of Curiosity's <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/msl/spacecraft/rover/wheels/\">chevron-pattern treads</a>, or grousers, Mars 2020 has straighter ones and twice as many per wheel (48 versus 24). Extensive testing in JPL's Mars Yard has shown these treads better withstand the pressure from sharp rocks but work just as well on sand.</p>\n\n<p><b>The Brains</b></p>\n\n<p>Mars rovers don't drive themselves. Teams of scientists and engineers beam meticulously programmed task lists to them at the beginning of each Mars day, or sol. Rover drivers on Earth then wait for the vehicle to report back before planning the next drive. The more a rover can do on its own, the more time drivers have to program new commands.</p>\n\n<p>After Curiosity landed, it took an average of 19 hours for the rover's team to analyze a day's data, build and test commands, then send those commands back to the rover. Years of honing operations shrunk the time it takes to develop each day's plan to seven hours, and a limited degree of auto-navigation has enabled Curiosity to take some cautious steps on its own.</p>\n\n<p>But Mars 2020 has even more self-driving smarts, allowing it to calculate a path five times faster than Curiosity can. That self-driving will be key to condensing the amount of time it takes for the 2020 team to plan each day's operations. The new mission intends to eventually condense daily operations to just five hours. The faster pace will allow it to cover more ground and gather more samples over the course of its prime mission. Mars 2020 won't move faster than its older sibling, but more automation means that it can potentially drive farther and collect more science without having to wait for engineers back on Earth.</p>\n\n<p><b>The Landing</b></p>\n\n<p>Curiosity transformed Mars landings with the seemingly radical <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/mission/timeline/entry-descent-landing/\">\"sky crane maneuver.\"</a> Mars 2020 will rely on the same process but also features an important new technology: <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/news/8456/a-neil-armstrong-for-mars-landing-the-mars-2020-rover/\">Terrain Relative Navigation</a>. An onboard computer matches surface images from a camera to a map to keep the spacecraft on target. Meanwhile, the Range Trigger lets the rover get miles closer to an ideal site before firing a parachute.</p>\n\n<p><b>The Humans to Come</b></p>\n\n<p>NASA's <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/what-is-artemis\" target=\"_blank\">Artemis program</a> aims to return astronauts to the Moon by 2024, preparing for future exploration of Mars. Helping pave the way for humans, Curiosity carries instruments that study the Martian environment, like surface radiation and weather.</p>\n\n<p>Besides studying the weather, Mars 2020 will <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/news/8449/nasas-mars-2020-will-blaze-a-trail-for-humans/\">carry spacesuit samples</a>, allowing scientists to study how they degrade. An <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/mission/instruments/moxie/\">oxygen generator</a> will test technology for astronauts to make their own rocket fuel from the Martian atmosphere. A <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/mission/instruments/rimfax/\">subsurface radar</a> like the one on the rover could someday be used to find buried water ice.</p>\n\n<p>For more information about Curiosity and Mars 2020, visit:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/msl/home/\"><b>https://mars.nasa.gov/msl/home/</b></a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/\"><b>https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/</b></a></p>\n\n<p><b>News Media Contacts</b></p>\n\n<p>Andrew Good<br />\nJet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif.<br />\n818-393-2433<br />\n<a href=\"mailto:andrew.c.good@jpl.nasa.gov\">andrew.c.good@jpl.nasa.gov</a></p>\n\n<p>Alana Johnson<br />\nNASA Headquarters, Washington<br />\n202-358-1501<br />\n<a href=\"mailto:alana.r.johnson@nasa.gov\">alana.r.johnson@nasa.gov</a></p>\n", "thumb": "/system/news_items/list_view_images/8567_PIA23517-320x240.jpg", "main_image": "/system/news_items/main_images/8567_PIA23517-16.jpg", "status": 1}, {"id": 8561, "title": "NASA's Briefcase-Size MarCO Satellite Picks Up Honors", "target": "_self", "main_image_alt": "Engineer Joel Steinkraus tests the solar arrays on one of the Mars Cube One ", "meta_author": "", "byline": "", "meta_keywords": "", "item_name": "", "updated_at": "2019-11-27T21:40:39.043Z", "url": "/news/8561/nasas-briefcase-size-marco-satellite-picks-up-honors/", "missions": [[183, "insight", "InSight"], [175, "mep", "Mars Exploration Program"]], "news_type": [[165, "feature", "Feature Stories"]], "description": "The twin spacecraft, the first of their kind to fly into deep space, earn a Laureate from Aviation Week & Space Technology.", "date": "November 27, 2019", "body": "<p>Aviation Week & Space Technology is bestowing a prestigious Laureate award on NASA's pair of briefcase-size Mars Cube One spacecraft.

And while scientists are still puzzling over the data, <a href=\"https://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/full/10.1175/JAS-D-19-0042.1\">two</a> <a href=\"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2019JE006110\">papers</a> recently shed new light on a phenomenon observed within the storm: dust towers, or concentrated clouds of dust that warm in sunlight and rise high into the air. Scientists think that dust-trapped water vapor may be riding them like an elevator to space, where solar radiation breaks apart their molecules. This might help explain how Mars' water disappeared over billions of years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dust towers are massive, churning clouds that are denser and climb much higher than the normal background dust in the thin Martian atmosphere. While they also occur under normal conditions, the towers appear to form in greater numbers during global storms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A tower starts at the planet's surface as an area of rapidly lifted dust about as wide as the state of Rhode Island. By the time a tower reaches a height of 50 miles (80 kilometers), as seen during the 2018 global dust storm, it may be as wide as Nevada. As the tower decays, it can form a layer of dust 35 miles (56 kilometers) above the surface that can be wider than the continental United States.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class='column-width image_module' style=''>\n<figure class='inline_figure'>\n<a href='/resources/24705/a-mars-dust-tower-stands-out/' target='_self'>\n<img alt='\"Dust tower\" on Mars' src='/system/resources/detail_files/24705_PIA23513-1000w.jpg'>\n</a>\n<figcaption>\n<b>A Mars Dust Tower Stands Out:</b> The yellow-white cloud in the bottom-center of this image is a Mars \"dust tower\" &mdash; a concentrated cloud of dust that can be lofted dozens of miles above the surface.

Though global dust storms cloak the planet's surface, MRO can use its heat-sensing Mars Climate Sounder instrument to peer through the haze. The instrument is designed specifically for measuring dust levels. Its data, coupled with images from a camera aboard the orbiter called the Mars Context Imager (MARCI), enabled scientists to detect numerous swelling dust towers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>How Did Mars Lose Its Water?</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dust towers appear throughout the Martian year, but MRO observed something different during the 2018 global dust storm. \"Normally the dust would fall down in a day or so,\" said the paper's lead author, Nicholas Heavens of Hampton University in Hampton, Virginia. \"But during a global storm, dust towers are renewed continuously for weeks.\" In some cases, multiple towers were seen for as long as 3 1/2 weeks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The rate of dust activity surprised Heavens and other scientists. But especially intriguing is the possibility that dust towers act as \"space elevators\" for other material, transporting them through the atmosphere. When airborne dust heats up, it creates updrafts that carry gases along with it, including the small quantity of water vapor sometimes seen as <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/news/8442/nasas-curiosity-mars-rover-finds-a-clay-cache/\">wispy clouds</a> on Mars. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>A previous paper led by Heavens showed that during a 2007 global dust storm on Mars, water molecules were <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/news/8299/dust-storms-linked-to-gas-escape-from-mars-atmosphere/\">lofted into the upper atmosphere</a>, where solar radiation could break them down into particles that escape into space. That might be a clue to how the Red Planet lost its lakes and rivers over billions of years, becoming the freezing desert it is today.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Scientists can't say with certainty what causes global dust storms; they've studied fewer than a dozen to date.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"Global dust storms are really unusual,\" said Mars Climate Sounder scientist David Kass of JPL. \"We really don't have anything like this on the Earth, where the entire planet's weather changes for several months.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With time and more data, the MRO team hopes to better understand the dust towers created within global storms and what role they may play in removing water from the Red Planet's atmosphere.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For more information about MRO:</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/mro/\"><b>mars.nasa.gov/mro/</b></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/MRO/main/index.html\"><b>www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/MRO/main/index.html</b></a></p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><b>News Media Contacts</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Andrew Good</span><br />\r\n<span>Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif.</span><br />\r\n818-393-2433<br />\r\n<a href=\"mailto:andrew.c.good@jpl.nasa.gov\">andrew.c.good@jpl.nasa.gov</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Alana Johnson<br />\r\nNASA Headquarters, Washington<br />\r\n202-358-1501<br />\r\n<a href=\"mailto:alana.r.johnson@nasa.gov\">alana.r.johnson@nasa.gov</a></p>\r\n", "thumb": "/system/news_items/list_view_images/8558_PIA23513-32x24.jpg", "main_image": "/system/news_items/main_images/8558_PIA22487_main.gif", "status": 1}, {"id": 8556, "title": "NASA Updates Mars 2020 Mission Environmental Review", "target": "_self", "main_image_alt": "The electricity needed to operate NASA's Mars 2020 rover (pictured here) is provided by a power system called a Multi-Mission Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generator, or MMRTG.", "meta_author": "", "byline": "", "meta_keywords": "", "item_name": "", "updated_at": "2019-11-21T19:27:32.541Z", "url": "/news/8556/nasa-updates-mars-2020-mission-environmental-review/", "missions": [[180, "mars2020", "Mars 2020 Rover"], [175, "mep", "Mars Exploration Program"]], "news_type": [[165, "feature", "Feature Stories"]], "description": "NASA and the Department of Energy have completed a more detailed risk analysis for the Mars 2020 rover launch from Florida.", "date": "November 21, 2019", "body": "<p>As NASA continues preparations for the summer 2020 Florida launch of its Mars 2020 rover, including the recent completion of testing the spacecraft in Mars-like conditions, public safety remains a top priority.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Detailed analysis of the potential radiological risks associated with launching a spacecraft powered by a radioisotope thermoelectric generator is part of standard operating procedures for NASA missions like Mars Curiosity and Pluto New Horizons. These missions use this type of power system to explore where solar power alone is not enough to get the job done.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For Mars 2020 that analysis started years ago, resulting in NASA's 2015 decision to use a radioisotope power system to provide electrical power for the rover, given that the risks were small. NASA and the Department of Energy (DOE) have continued to evaluate the potential radiological impacts of the launch and have completed a more detailed risk analysis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On Oct. 25, that analysis and other updated information were released for public comment in a draft Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement (SEIS). The draft<a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/news/newsroom/eis/\"> SEIS</a> is available now for public review and comment. Public meetings on the draft were held in the Cape Canaveral area and online during the week of Nov. 11.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The new analysis finds that the most probable outcome for Mars 2020 is a successful launch. An accident during launch is unlikely, and the estimated chance of an accident with a release of radiological material from the rover's power system is small: 1 in 960 across all possible accident scenarios. In the case of a release, the resulting estimated maximum radiation dose for an exposed individual in the launch area who takes no protective actions would be low, equivalent to approximately eight months of natural background radiation for the average U.S. resident.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The launch period for the Mars 2020 mission opens on July 17, 2020. After the spacecraft lands on the Martian surface on Feb. 18, 2021, the rover will search for signs of past microbial life, characterize the planet's climate and geology, and collect samples for future return to Earth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The system that provides electrical power for Mars 2020 and its scientific equipment is essentially a nuclear battery that uses the natural radioactive decay from plutonium dioxide as a heat source to produce power and warm internal systems. NASA has a long and successful record of performance with these power systems. The system on Mars 2020, known as the Multi-Mission Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generator (MMRTG), is the same as the one on the Curiosity rover, which launched from Cape Canaveral in 2011 and continues to operate on Mars. Similar power systems have flown on more than two dozen U.S. space missions since 1961.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even though the chances of launch accidents are small, NASA prepares response plans for all of its launches to be ready to protect the public. To manage the response to an accident with a possible release of radioactive material in the launch area, NASA establishes an assessment and operations center staffed by a variety of subject matter experts that deploys monitoring devices and field teams equipped with specialized instruments prior to launch. NASA also assembles a multi-agency communications team that serves as a clearinghouse for timely and accessible information updates on accident conditions and any recommendations on precautionary measures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The public comment period for the Mars 2020 draft SEIS is open through Dec. 10.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>News Media Contact</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Steve Cole<br />\r\nNASA Headquarters, Washington<br />\r\n202-358-0918</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"mailto:stephen.e.cole@nasa.gov\">stephen.e.cole@nasa.gov</a></p>\r\n", "thumb": "/system/news_items/list_view_images/8556_PIA23305_320x240px.jpg", "main_image": "/system/news_items/main_images/8556_PIA23305-16.jpg", "status": 1}, {"id": 8554, "title": "Two of a Space Kind: Apollo 12 and Mars 2020", "target": "_self", "main_image_alt": "(Left) Apollo 12 astronaut Charles \u201cPete\u201d Conrad Jr. stands beside NASA's Surveyor 3 spacecraft; the lunar module Intrepid can be seen in the distance.

Next July, NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA) are launching rovers to Mars that will search for signs of past microbial life, and to find them, the scientists with NASA's Mars 2020 mission and ESA's ExoMars will need to examine different kinds of rocks that lend compelling insights into the environment in which they were made &mdash; all from 100 million miles away. </p>\n\n<p>\"While we expect to find many significant rocks during both Mars 2020 and ExoMars missions, we also have to leave open the possibility we could find one or more <i>very special</i> rocks<i>,</i> the kind whose discovery would not only speak volumes about the history of Mars but contribute significantly to the discussion of life elsewhere in the universe,\" said Ken Farley, Mars 2020 project scientist at Caltech in Pasadena.</p>\n\n<p>Guided by Martin Van Kranendonk, director of the Australian Centre for Astrobiology at the University of New South Wales, members of the two missions' science teams went on an expedition to northwestern Australia's Pilbara region to analyze, discuss and debate stromatolites &mdash; structures preserved in rock that formed in water on early Earth and contain a fossilized record of ancient microbial life. Among the science teams' stops: a stromatolite cluster in a grouping of rock called the Dresser Formation that contains some of the oldest known fossilized records of life on our world.</p>\n\n<p>\"Some 3.48 billion years ago, this area was home to a caldera, or collapsed volcano, filled with hot, bubbling seawater,\" said Van Kranendonk. \"At the same time, this location was also home to structures called microbial mats &mdash; visible to the naked eye but composed of microscopic organisms. Today you would know them as simple pond scum, but back then they were the most complex life forms on Earth.\"</p>\n\n<p>Likely powered by photosynthesis, along with the heat and chemical energy in the caldera, these mats lived at the water's edge, secreting a mucous that would trap grains of sediment swirling around in the water. Over time, sheet after sheet of these microbes trapped sediment on top of previous layers. When the seawater receded and the pond scum dried up and disappeared millennia later, what remained was striking evidence of this co-evolution of geology and biology.</p>\n\n<p>\"A stromatolite is quite subtle to the untrained eye,\" said Van Kranendonk. \"But once you know the details, you recognize that these wavy, wrinkly rocks have a structure different from that which can be explained by just geology.\"  </p>\n\n<div class='column-width image_module' style=''>\n<figure class='inline_figure'>\n<a href='/resources/24695/researching-outback-stromatolites/' target='_self'>\n<img alt=\"Scientists from NASA's Mars 2020 and ESA's ExoMars projects study stromatolites, the oldest confirmed fossilized lifeforms on Earth, in the Pilbara region of North West Australia.

The conditions were ideal for stromatolites to form on the shorelines, which is one key reason the rover team will be touching down there in February 2021. \"It's hard to think of a better recipe for life to thrive &mdash; and for its record to be preserved &mdash; than the one we see at Jezero,\" said Ken Williford, deputy project scientist for Mars 2020 at JPL.</p>\n\n<p>If stromatolites ever existed in Jezero or at Oxia Planum, the ExoMars landing site, the teams need to know what to look for, hence this trip to the Outback. But that's not the only reason they came.     </p>\n\n<p>\"I organized this first joint Mars 2020-ExoMars science expedition so scientists from our two great missions could gain a new perspective on these one-of-a-kind stromatolites; a laboratory setting just can't provide the same context,\" said Mitch Schulte, Mars 2020 program scientist at NASA Headquarters in Washington. \"That applies to the experience as a whole, too &mdash; the conversations, comparing of notes and planning for future exchanges that was done here in the Pilbara will go a long way to advance Mars science.\" </p>\n\n<p><b>Two Missions, Two Rovers</b></p>\n\n<p>While the two missions both seek to find evidence of past life, each is approaching the challenge in its own way. Touching down about a week after Mars 2020, the ExoMars rover, otherwise known as the Rosalind Franklin<i>,</i> carries a core drill that on two or more occasions will bore almost 7 feet (2 meters) into the Martian crust. The rover will analyze the samples onsite with a sophisticated suite of scientific instruments. </p>\n\n<p>The coring mechanism on NASA's Mars 2020 rover drills shallower holes but is designed to collect more than 40 rock and soil core samples. There will be on-site analysis of rocks at the coring sites, and the samples themselves will be sealed in metal tubes that will ultimately be deposited by the rover at specific sites. Future missions could then retrieve those samples and return them to Earth for the sort of laboratory analysis that just isn't possible on Mars.  </p>\n\n<p>\"These two Mars missions will be revolutionary because they are complementary,\" said Teresa Fornaro, a science team member for the Mars Organic Molecule Analyzer instrument aboard ExoMars. \"Two different rovers with two different sets of instruments, exploring at the same time two different landing sites. Some of the capabilities of Mars 2020 in characterizing the surface environment could help guide ExoMars on where to drill. Conversely, knowledge of the alteration of possible organics as a function of depth by ExoMars could help Mars 2020 select the most interesting surface samples to collect for future return to Earth.\"  </p>\n\n<p>When the joint Mars 2020-ExoMars science Outback expedition concluded in late August, the science teams went their separate ways. But to those who honed their stromatolite-hunting skills in the Pilbara, the influence of the trip continues. </p>\n\n<p>\"What is happening working out here in the field is also happening in the halls of NASA and ESA,\" said Schulte. \"Finding evidence of life on another world, if it ever existed, will require tenacity and a whole lot of brainpower. If there is a stromatolite in the range of the rovers, I think we have a good chance of finding it ... and we'll find it together. This trip will have helped with that.\"</p>\n\n<p>The launch window for Mars 2020 opens on July 17, 2020. It will land at Mars' Jezero Crater on Feb. 18, 2021.

As a result, they noticed something baffling: oxygen, the gas many Earth creatures use to breathe, behaves in a way that so far scientists cannot explain through any known chemical processes.</p>\n\n<p>Over the course of three Mars years (or nearly six Earth years) an instrument in the <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/msl/spacecraft/instruments/sam/\">Sample Analysis at Mars</a> (SAM) portable chemistry lab inside the belly of NASA&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/msl/home/\">Curiosity rover</a> inhaled the air of Gale Crater and analyzed its composition. The results SAM spit out confirmed the makeup of the Martian atmosphere at the surface: 95% by volume of carbon dioxide (<span>CO</span><sub><span>2</span></sub>), 2.6% molecular nitrogen (N<sub><span>2</span></sub>), 1.9% argon (Ar), 0.16% molecular oxygen (O<sub><span>2</span></sub>), and 0.06% carbon monoxide (CO). They also revealed how the molecules in the Martian air mix and circulate with the changes in air pressure throughout the year. These changes are caused when <span>CO</span><sub>2 </sub>gas freezes over the poles in the winter, thereby lowering the air pressure across the planet following redistribution of air to maintain pressure equilibrium. When <span>CO</span><sub>2 </sub>evaporates in the spring and summer and mixes across Mars, it raises the air pressure.</p>\n\n<p>Within this environment, scientists found that nitrogen and argon follow a predictable seasonal pattern, waxing and waning in concentration in Gale Crater throughout the year relative to how much <span>CO</span><sub>2 </sub>is in the air. They expected oxygen to do the same. But it didn&rsquo;t. Instead, the amount of the gas in the air rose throughout spring and summer by as much as 30%, and then dropped back to levels predicted by known chemistry in fall. This pattern repeated each spring, though the amount of oxygen added to the atmosphere varied, implying that something was producing it and then taking it away.</p>\n\n<div class='column-width image_module' style=''>\n<figure class='inline_figure'>\n<a class='inline_image_enlarge fancybox' href='/system/internal_resources/details/original/838_Seasonal_Variations_in_Oxygen_at_Gale_Crater.jpeg'>\n<img alt='Graph showing oxygen concentration through Mars seasons' src='/internal_resources/838'>\n<div class='enlarge_icon'></div>\n</a>\n<figcaption>\n<b>Seasonal Variations in Oxygen at Gale Crater</b>: Graph showing oxygen concentration through Mars seasons.

Atreya is a co-author of a paper on this topic published on November 12 in the Journal of Geophysical Research: Planets.</p>\n\n<p>As soon as scientists discovered the oxygen enigma, Mars experts set to work trying to explain it. They first double- and triple-checked the accuracy of the SAM instrument they used to measure the gases: the Quadrupole Mass Spectrometer. The instrument was fine. They considered the possibility that <span>CO</span><sub>2 </sub>or water (H<sub><span>2</span></sub>O) molecules could have released oxygen when they broke apart in the atmosphere, leading to the short-lived rise. But it would take five times more water above Mars to produce the extra oxygen, and <span>CO</span><sub>2 </sub><span> </span>breaks up too slowly to generate it over such a short time. What about the oxygen decrease? Could solar radiation have broken up oxygen molecules into two atoms that blew away into space? No, scientists concluded, since it would take at least 10 years for the oxygen to disappear through this process.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re struggling to explain this,&rdquo; said <a href=\"https://science.gsfc.nasa.gov/sed/bio/melissa.trainer\" target=\"_blank\">Melissa Trainer</a>, a planetary scientist at NASA&rsquo;s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland who led this research. &ldquo;The fact that the oxygen behavior isn&rsquo;t perfectly repeatable every season makes us think that it&rsquo;s not an issue that has to do with atmospheric dynamics. It has to be some chemical source and sink that we can&rsquo;t yet account for.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>To scientists who study Mars, the oxygen story is curiously similar to that of methane. Methane is constantly in the air inside Gale Crater in such small quantities (0.00000004% on average) that it&rsquo;s barely discernable even by the most sensitive instruments on Mars. Still, it&rsquo;s been measured by SAM&rsquo;s Tunable Laser Spectrometer. The instrument revealed that while methane rises and falls seasonally, it increases in abundance by about 60% in summer months for inexplicable reasons. (In fact, methane also <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/news/8452/curiositys-mars-methane-mystery-continues/?site=msl\">spikes randomly and dramatically</a>. Scientists are trying to figure out why.)</p>\n\n<p>With the new oxygen findings in hand, Trainer&rsquo;s team is wondering if chemistry similar to what&rsquo;s driving methane&rsquo;s natural seasonal variations may also drive oxygen&rsquo;s. At least occasionally, the two gases appear to fluctuate in tandem.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re beginning to see this tantalizing correlation between methane and oxygen for a good part of the Mars year,&rdquo; Atreya said. &ldquo;I think there&rsquo;s something to it. I just don&rsquo;t have the answers yet. Nobody does.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<div class='column-width image_module' style=''>\n<figure class='inline_figure'>\n<a class='inline_image_enlarge fancybox' href='/system/internal_resources/details/original/839_Seasonal_Variations_in_Oxygen_and_Methane_at_Gale_Crater.jpeg'>\n<img alt='Seasonal Variations in Oxygen and Methane at Gale Crater' src='/internal_resources/839'>\n<div class='enlarge_icon'></div>\n</a>\n<figcaption>\n<b>Seasonal Variations in Oxygen and Methane at Gale Crater: </b>Methane and oxygen trends on Mars. Image credit: Melissa Trainer/Dan Gallagher/NASA Goddard\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n\n<p>Oxygen and methane can be produced both biologically (from microbes, for instance) and abiotically (from chemistry related to water and rocks). Scientists are considering all options, although they don&rsquo;t have any convincing evidence of biological activity on Mars. Curiosity doesn't have instruments that can definitively say whether the source of the methane or oxygen on Mars is biological or geological. Scientists expect that non-biological explanations are more likely and are working diligently to fully understand them.</p>\n\n<p>Trainer&rsquo;s team considered Martian soil as a source of the extra springtime oxygen. After all, it&rsquo;s known to be rich in the element, in the form of compounds such as hydrogen peroxide and perchlorates. One experiment on the Viking landers showed decades ago that heat and humidity could release oxygen from Martian soil. But that experiment took place in conditions quite different from the Martian spring environment, and it doesn&rsquo;t explain the oxygen drop, among other problems. Other possible explanations also don&rsquo;t quite add up for now. For example, high-energy radiation of the soil could produce extra O<sub><span>2</span></sub> in the air, but it would take a million years to accumulate enough oxygen in the soil to account for the boost measured in only one spring, the researchers report in their paper.</p>\n\n<div class='image_module right' style=''>\n<figure class='inline_figure'>\n<a class='inline_image_enlarge fancybox' href='/system/resources/detail_files/3349_PIA00567.jpg'>\n<img alt='Sunset at the Viking Lander 1 site, 1976.' src='/system/resources/detail_files/3349_PIA00567.jpg'>\n<div class='enlarge_icon'></div>\n</a>\n<figcaption>\n<b>Sunset at the Viking Lander 1 Site, 1976:</b> This color image of the Martian surface in the Chryse area was taken by Viking Lander 1, looking southwest, about 15 minutes before sunset on the evening of August 21.

The Viking experiments covered only a few Martian days, though, so they couldn&rsquo;t reveal seasonal patterns of the different gases. The new SAM measurements are the first to do so. The SAM team will continue to measure atmospheric gases so scientists can gather more detailed data throughout each season. In the meantime, Trainer and her team hope that other Mars experts will work to solve the oxygen mystery.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;This is the first time where we&rsquo;re seeing this interesting behavior over multiple years. We don&rsquo;t totally understand it,&rdquo; Trainer said. &ldquo;For me, this is an open call to all the smart people out there who are interested in this: See what you can come up with.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p><b><i>By </i><a href=\"mailto:lonnie.shekhtman@nasa.gov?subject=Mars%20oxygen\">Lonnie Shekhtman</a><br />\n<i>NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Md.</i></b></p>\n", "thumb": "/system/news_items/list_view_images/8548_mars_seasonal_oxygen_gale_crater-320x240.jpg", "main_image": "/system/news_items/main_images/8548_22497_PIA23243-1000w.gif", "status": 1}, {"id": 8545, "title": "NASA's Mars 2020 Heads Into the Test Chamber", "target": "_self", "main_image_alt": "In this time-lapse video taken at JPL, engineers move the Mars 2020 rover into a large vacuum chamber for testing in Mars-like environmental conditions.", "meta_author": "", "byline": "", "meta_keywords": "", "item_name": "", "updated_at": "2019-11-07T18:35:37.539Z", "url": "/news/8545/nasas-mars-2020-heads-into-the-test-chamber/", "missions": [[180, "mars2020", "Mars 2020 Rover"], [175, "mep", "Mars Exploration Program"]], "news_type": [[165, "feature", "Feature Stories"]], "description": "In this time-lapse video taken at JPL, engineers move the Mars 2020 rover into a large vacuum chamber for testing in Mars-like environmental conditions.", "date": "November  7, 2019", "body": "<figure class='column-width embedded_video video_player_container'>\n<div class='video_wrapper'>\n<iframe width=\"1225\" height=\"689\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/7SFh4TZRXHg?list=PLTiv_XWHnOZqCrMU2ppcLjRn1zlDkNx3q\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div>\n<figcaption>\n<b>NASA&rsquo;s 2020 Rover Moves into Mars Simulation Chamber (time lapse)</b>: In this time-lapse video, taken at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, bunny-suited engineers move the Mars 2020 rover into a large vacuum chamber for testing in Mars-like environmental conditions. <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/resources/24679/\">Full caption and download &rsaquo;</a>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n<p>In this time-lapse video, taken on Oct. 9, 2019, at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, bunny-suited engineers move the Mars 2020 rover from a high bay in the Spacecraft Simulator Building into the facility&rsquo;s large vacuum chamber for testing in Mars-like environmental conditions.</p>\n\n<p>\"Whenever you move the rover, it is a big deal,\" said Mars 2020 engineer Chris Chatellier of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. \"There is a technician on every corner, and other engineers and safety inspectors are monitoring and assisting every step of the way.

If it stops making progress, they might scrape soil on top of the mole, adding mass to resist the mole's recoil.</p>\n\n<p>If no other options exist, they would consider pressing the scoop down directly on the top of the mole while trying to avoid the sensitive tether there; the tether provides power to and relays data from the instrument.</p>\n\n<p>\"The mole still has a way to go, but we're all thrilled to see it digging again,\" said Troy Hudson of JPL, an engineer and scientist who has led the mole recovery effort. \"When we first encountered this problem, it was crushing. But I thought, 'Maybe there's a chance; let's keep pressing on.' And right now, I'm feeling giddy.\"</p>\n\n<p><b>About InSight</b></p>\n\n<p>JPL manages InSight for NASA's Science Mission Directorate.

The following Q&As with two members of the team answer some of the most common questions about the burrowing device, part of a science instrument called the Heat Flow and Physical Properties Package (HP3).", "date": "November  6, 2019", "body": "<p><b>Q: Why can't you pick up the 'mole' and move it to another spot?</b></p>\n\n<p><b>A:</b> The mole is part of the instrument called the <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/insight/spacecraft/instruments/hp3/\">Heat Flow and Physical Properties Package</a>, or HP<sup>3</sup>, and was designed to be housed within HP<sup>3</sup>'s support structure. The support structure of HP<sup>3</sup> was outfitted with a knob, or \"grapple point,\" that the robotic arm can grasp in order to move it from the lander's deck onto the Martian surface. Designed to be housed within the support structure, the mole itself has no grapple point and was not intended to be grasped or moved.</p>\n\n<p>Even if the mole <i>could</i> be moved, relocating it would be an unlikely solution. The team is confident that the probe has been unable to dig because the soil doesn't provide enough friction. Anywhere you move the mole near the lander would likely pose the same problem. The strategy of \"<a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/news/8518/nasas-push-to-save-the-mars-insight-landers-heat-probe/?site=insight\">pinning</a>\" &mdash; pressing the robotic arm's scoop against the side of the mole &mdash; compensates for that lack of friction and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NASAInSight/status/1186328153469272072\" target=\"_blank\">helped the mole</a> progress downward in early October.</p>\n\n<p><b>Q: Why doesn't the mole include a drill?</b></p>\n\n<p><b>A:</b> A drill would require a much bigger, more powerful motor than what the InSight lander can accommodate. It would also require more power than the solar-powered lander can practically provide. What's more, a drill would require rigging to stabilize it as the motor spins, just like with a drill press. Rigging cancels out the force of a drill's spin, which would otherwise spin the motor in the other direction.</p>\n\n<p>About 1 inch (2.7 centimeters) in diameter and about 16 inches (40 centimeters) long, the mole was designed to be light enough and small enough to suit the constraints of the lander deck. It functions somewhat like a pile driver: A motor attached to a gearbox inside the mole slowly compresses and then quickly releases a spring that drives a tungsten hammer against the interior of the mole tip, at a pace of one stroke every 3.7 seconds.</p>\n\n<p><b>Q: Are you sure the mole didn't hit a rock?</b></p>\n\n<p><b>A:</b> Most of the team remains confident that a rock didn't cause the mole to rebound. The landing site, Elysium Planitia, was selected partly because it has so few visible rocks, implying few large subsurface rocks. The mole is strong enough to nudge small rocks out of its way and was designed to go around medium-size rocks &mdash; anything less than about 4 inches (10 centimeters) in diameter &mdash; once it's fully buried.</p>\n\n<p>Further analysis will be required to determine why the mole backed out of the hole once there was too little mole exposed above the Martian surface to make pinning possible.</p>\n\n<p><b>Q: </b><b>How much of a factor is Mars' reduced gravity when trying to replicate the mole&rsquo;s behavior on Earth?</b></p>\n\n<p><b>A:</b> The <a href=\"https://youtu.be/ZSXnw-fJbGk\" target=\"_blank\">robotic arm testbed</a> at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, uses weight models (nonfunctional replicas of the instruments that are the weight they would be on Mars) to simulate the effects of the Red Planet's reduced gravity. But certain experiments, like ones involving the mole digging, cannot be fully re-created: The team can't simulate low gravity at the Earth's surface. It wouldn't be possible to make a lightweight version of the mole for testing that has the same digging power as the mole that's on Mars.</p>\n\n<p><b>Q: </b><b>Is there any chance the hammering mechanism is damaged?</b></p>\n\n<p><b>A:</b> The InSight science team hasn't seen any noticeable difference between the performance of the mole on Mars and what has been seen in testing on Earth. InSight's seismometer can detect the vibrations from each of the mole's hammer strokes and is being used to analyze tiny (millisecond-level) variations in each stroke. To date, the team hasn't seen evidence that the hammering mechanism is damaged.</p>\n\n<p><b>Q: </b><b>Despite the challenges it poses to the mole, is the soil teaching us anything new about Mars?</b></p>\n\n<p><b>A:</b> Absolutely! The mole was designed with the loose, sandy soils seen by the Spirit and Opportunity rovers in mind. The soil under InSight is mechanically different from what we've seen at other landing sites. The formation of the pit around the probe, the resistance of the pit to collapsing and the interesting self-extraction of the mole are all surprising and will be investigated by the InSight science team to revise its understanding of the formation and variations of the Martian soil.</p>\n\n<p><b>Q: </b><b>Why push the mole from the side rather than applying pressure from above?</b></p>\n\n<p><b>A:</b> Pushing from the side allowed the InSight team to almost fully bury the mole in October 2019; it's a technique that appears to work well. The team wants to avoid pressing on top of the mole, where a sensitive tether supplying power and relaying data sticks out. It's still possible that the team will press down on the top of the mole if there are no other options, but they have been pressing from the side until now because it's safer for all of the hardware.</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p><b>June 5, 2019</b></p>\n\n<p>There's a new plan to get InSight's \"mole\" moving again. The following Q&As with two members of the team answer some of the most common questions about the burrowing device, part of a science instrument called the Heat Flow and Physical Properties Package (HP<sup>3</sup>).</p>\n\n<p><i>HP<sup>3</sup> Principal Investigator Tilman Spohn of the German Aerospace Center (DLR), which provided the instrument.</i></p>\n\n<p><b>Q: What do you suspect is preventing the mole from digging further?</b></p>\n\n<p><b>A:</b> We don't know for sure, because we can't see underground. That's why we want to lift the support structure. But we're fairly confident the problem is a lack of friction in the soil.</p>\n\n<p>The mole is designed for loose soil to flow around it, providing friction that keeps the mole from bouncing backwards with recoil. The soil around InSight provides much less friction than what we've seen before on Mars. We have several ideas for why this is. One is that the soil compacts and holds together so well that the mole may have created a small cavity around itself while hammering, preventing it from getting the friction it needs to dig. <a href=\"https://www.dlr.de/dlr/en/desktopdefault.aspx/tabid-10212/332_read-33208/#/gallery/34019\" target=\"_blank\">Tests conducted in Germany have confirmed this could happen</a>.</p>\n\n<p>There's also the possibility that we've hit a rock. The mole was designed to go around smaller rocks &mdash; no bigger than a few inches [or centimeters] in size &mdash; but it may be pinned between the rock and the support structure. If that's the case, moving the support structure may allow it to keep digging. If it's hit a larger rock, there's not much we can do.</p>\n\n<p><b>Q: Why couldn't the team anticipate the soil issue or hitting a rock?</b></p>\n\n<p><b>A:</b> We always knew there were environmental risks that could stop the mole. What we did is prepare as best we could so that they were calculated risks.</p>\n\n<p>The low-friction soil was unexpected: Everywhere else on Mars, soil has been different, which was what the mole was built for. We also knew there would be rocks underground, so we deliberately chose a landing site that was flat and had as few rocks as possible on the surface. Based on what we can see, the chances of hitting a rock this close to the surface that the mole can't go around is only a few percent.</p>\n\n<p><b>Q: What will happen once you lift the support structure?</b></p>\n\n<p><b>A:</b> It depends on what we see. First, we'll try a short hammering sequence with the mole. Then, regardless of whether there's a cavity around the mole, we will likely press on the soil with a small scoop on the robotic arm to provide a load on the surface. Our calculations suggest that this should increase the friction and could help it dig.</p>\n\n<p><b>Q: When would that occur?</b></p>\n\n<p><b>A:</b> We hope to lift the support structure by the end of June and to have our next steps decided by mid-July. After that, we will need time to run more tests.</p>\n\n<p><i>Engineer-scientist Troy Hudson of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, which leads the InSight mission.</i></p>\n\n<p><b>Q: Why are you lifting the support structure in three steps?</b></p>\n\n<p><b>A:</b> There are springs inside of the support structure that may still be in contact with the top of the mole. If that's the case, we want to be careful lifting the structure so that we don't accidentally pull the mole out. If that happened, we won't be able to insert it back into its hole in the soil. So we'll lift the support structure a little bit at a time, checking to make sure the mole isn't coming with it.</p>\n\n<p><b>Q: Why has it taken so much time to plan these next steps?</b></p>\n\n<p><b>A:</b> We don't want to take an action that makes the situation worse, so we've been moving very carefully. InSight is also a Discovery class mission, meaning it was meant to be more affordable &mdash; and to accept more risk &mdash; than a flagship NASA mission. So the team is very small; we don't command the lander every day, and commands that are sent up need to be rigorously tested to make sure they'll work the way we want them to. We want every action to be safe for HP<sup>3</sup>, the robotic arm <i>and</i> InSight's seismometer, which is very close by.</p>\n\n<p><b>\u200b</b><b>About InSight</b></p>\n\n<p>JPL manages InSight for NASA's Science Mission Directorate.

It can also roll over obstacles and through depressions the size of its wheels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Mars 2020 rover was photographed in the Simulator Building at JPL, where it underwent weeks of testing, including an extensive evaluation of how its instruments, systems and subsystems operate in the frigid, near-vacuum environment it will face on Mars.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPL is building and will manage operations of the Mars 2020 rover for NASA.

Visible in the left foreground are two holes Curiosity drilled named \"Glen Etive 1\" (right) and \"Glen Etive 2\" (left) by the science team. The rover can analyze the chemical composition of rock samples by powderizing them with the drill, then dropping the samples into a portable lab in its belly called Sample Analysis at Mars (SAM).</p>\n\n<p>About 984 feet (300 meters) behind the rover is Vera Rubin Ridge, which Curiosity <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/news/8405/curiosity-says-farewell-to-mars-vera-rubin-ridge/?site=msl\">departed</a> nearly a year ago. Beyond the ridge, you can see the floor of Gale Crater and the crater's northern rim. Curiosity has been ascending Mount Sharp, a 3-mile-tall (5-kilometer-tall) mountain inside the crater.</p>\n\n<p>The special chemistry experiment occurred on Sept. 24, 2019, after the rover placed the powderized sample from Glen Etive 2 into SAM. The portable lab contains 74 small cups used for testing samples. Most of the cups function as miniature ovens that heat the samples; SAM then \"sniffs\" the gases that bake off, looking for chemicals that hold clues about the Martian environment billions of years ago, when the planet was friendlier to microbial life.</p>\n\n<p>But nine of SAM's 74 cups are filled with solvents the rover can use for special \"wet chemistry\" experiments. These chemicals make it easier for SAM to detect certain carbon-based molecules important to the formation of life, called organic compounds.</p>\n\n<p>Because there's a limited number of wet-chemistry cups, the science team has been saving them for just the right conditions. In fact, the experiment at Glen Etive is only the second time Curiosity has performed wet chemistry since touching down on Mars in August 2012.</p>\n\n<p>\"We've been eager to find an area that would be compelling enough to do wet chemistry,\" said SAM Principal Investigator Paul Mahaffy of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. \"Now that we're in the clay-bearing unit, we've finally got it.\" </p>\n\n<p>Clay-based rocks are good at preserving chemical compounds, which break down over time and when bombarded by radiation from space and the Sun. The science team is intrigued to see which organic compounds, if any, have been preserved in the rocks at Glen Etive. Understanding how this area formed will give them a better idea of how the Martian climate was changing billions of years ago.</p>\n\n<p>While this marks Curiosity's second wet-chemistry experiment, it is the rover's first on a drilled sample. In December 2016, when <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/news/8314/curiosity-tests-a-new-way-to-drill-on-mars/?site=msl\">Curiosity's drill malfunctioned</a>, the rover still had a bit of sand that had been scooped up in a place called \"Ogunquit Beach.\" It wasn't a drilled sample, but the team wasn't sure whether they'd get the drill working and be able to perform wet chemistry in the future. So they delivered the Ogunquit Beach sand into one of SAM's wet chemistry cups since there was still science to be gained.</p>\n\n<p>Scientists consider Glen Etive a strategic location that will reveal more about how the clay-bearing unit formed. They built upon the valuable dress rehearsal at Ogunquit Beach to make adjustments that improved the recent experiment.</p>\n\n<p>The results will be known next year. \"SAM's data is extremely complex and takes time to interpret,\" Mahaffy said. \"But we're all eager to see what we can learn from this new location, Glen Etive.\"</p>\n\n<p><span>The individual images in this selfie were taken by the Mars Hand Lens Imager (MAHLI), a camera on the end of the rover's robotic arm.

But after winning the naming contest, there was a lot of attention on me &mdash; unlike anything I'd ever known. My life would not be the same if I hadn't spoken up to articulate my thoughts.\"</p>\n\n<p><b>Meet Clara</b></p>\n\n<p>In 2008, Ma was a 12-year-old sixth grader in a Kansas City suburb and was just starting to develop an interest in science. She had recently entered her first science fair and watched a movie about a journey from Earth to the far reaches of the universe. As she looked up at the night sky above Lenexa, Kansas, her head practically exploded thinking about the mysteries of the cosmos.</p>\n\n<p>When Ma read a magazine article about NASA's essay contest to name the next Mars rover, she knew precisely which name to propose: \"Curiosity is the passion that drives us through our everyday lives,\" Ma wrote in her short <a href=\"https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=2171\" target=\"_blank\">essay</a>. \"We have become explorers and scientists with our need to ask questions and to wonder.\"</p>\n\n<p>She <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/news/99/nasa-selects-students-entry-as-new-mars-rover-name/?site=msl\">won</a> the contest; the rover <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/msl/home/\">Curiosity</a> launched in 2011 and is hard at work today looking into whether ancient Mars ever had the right environmental conditions to support life.</p>\n\n<p>\"The experience of naming the rover and everything that came with it changed my life,\" Ma said recently. One key part of the experience was getting to speak with so many NASA scientists and engineers of different backgrounds; several of them became longtime mentors.</p>\n\n<p>\"It was so inspiring to meet people who were asking questions about the world and the universe for a living,\" she said. \"It made me realize that was something I could do with my life: I could be a scientist, too.\"</p>\n\n<p><b>Where is she now?</b></p>\n\n<p>Ma graduated earlier this year with a degree in geophysics from Yale University. Her coursework and research focused in particular on how Earth's atmosphere, oceans and climate interact with one another. She is completing a master's degree in science, technology and environmental policy at the University of Cambridge in the U.K.</p>\n\n<p>\"Thinking about sending a robot to another planet made me realize how special and fragile life is on Earth,\" she said. \"Space is incredibly vast. There are trillions and trillions of planets out there. And yet we're still the only place that we know of where life exists.

Looking across the entirety of Curiosity's journey, which began in 2012, the science team sees a cycle of wet to dry across long timescales on Mars.</p>\n\n<p><span>\"As we climb Mount Sharp, we see an overall trend from a wet landscape to a drier one,\" said Curiosity Project Scientist Ashwin Vasavada of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. JPL leads the Mars Science Laboratory mission that Curiosity is a part of. \"But that trend didn't necessarily occur in a linear fashion. More likely, it was messy, including drier periods, like what we're seeing at Sutton Island, followed by wetter periods, like what we're seeing in the 'clay-bearing unit' that Curiosity is exploring today.\"</span></p>\n\n<p>Up until now, the rover has encountered lots of flat sediment layers that had been gently deposited at the bottom of a lake. Team member Chris Fedo, who specializes in the study of sedimentary layers at the University of Tennessee, noted that Curiosity is currently running across large rock structures that could have formed only in a higher-energy environment such as a windswept area or flowing streams.</p>\n\n<p>Wind or flowing water piles sediment into layers that gradually incline. When they harden into rock, they become large structures similar to <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/news/8498/new-finds-for-mars-rover-seven-years-after-landing/?site=msl\">\"Teal Ridge,\"</a> which Curiosity investigated this past summer.</p>\n\n<p>\"Finding inclined layers represents a major change, where the landscape isn't completely underwater anymore,\" said Fedo. \"We may have left the era of deep lakes behind.\"</p>\n\n<p>Curiosity has already spied more inclined layers in the distant sulfate-bearing unit. The science team plans to drive there in the next couple years and investigate its many rock structures. If they formed in drier conditions that persisted for a long period, that might mean that the clay-bearing unit represents an in-between stage &mdash; a gateway to a different era in Gale Crater's watery history.</p>\n\n<p>\"We can't say whether we're seeing wind or river deposits yet in the clay-bearing unit, but we're comfortable saying is it's definitely not the same thing as what came before or what lies ahead,\" Fedo said.</p>\n\n<p>For more about NASA's Curiosity Mars rover mission, visit:</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/msl/\"><b>https://mars.nasa.gov/msl/</b></a></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><a href=\"https://nasa.gov/msl\" target=\"_blank\"><b>https://nasa.gov/msl</b></a></p>\n\n<p><b>News Media Contact</b></p>\n\n<p>Andrew Good<br />\nJet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif.<br />\n818-393-2433<br />\n<a href=\"mailto:andrew.c.good@jpl.nasa.gov\">andrew.c.good@jpl.nasa.gov</a></p>\n\n<p>Alana Johnson<br />\nNASA Headquarters, Washington<br />\n202-358-1501<br />\n<a href=\"mailto:alana.r.johnson@nasa.gov\">alana.r.johnson@nasa.gov</a></p>\n", "thumb": "/system/news_items/list_view_images/8522_PIA21261-320x240.jpg", "main_image": "/system/news_items/main_images/8522_PIA21261_hires.jpg", "status": 1}, {"id": 8520, "title": "NASA's Mars 2020 Rover Tests Descent-Stage Separation", "target": "_self", "main_image_alt": "Engineers and technicians working on the Mars 2020 spacecraft, look on as a crane lifts the rocket-powered descent stage away from the rover after a test.

InSight team engineer Ashitey Trebbi-Ollennu, based at NASA&rsquo;s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, explains what has been attempted and the game plan for the coming weeks. The next tactic they'll try will be \"pinning\" the mole against the hole it's in. Credits: NASA/JPL-Caltech\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n<p>\"We're going to try pressing the side of the scoop against the mole, pinning it to the wall of its hole,\" said InSight Deputy Principal Investigator Sue Smrekar of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. \"This might increase friction enough to keep it moving forward when mole hammering resumes.\"</p>\n\n<p>Whether the extra pressure on the mole will compensate for the unique soil remains an unknown.</p>\n\n<p>Designed to burrow as much as 16 feet (5 meters) underground to record the amount of heat escaping from the planet's interior, the mole needs friction from surrounding soil in order to dig: Without it, recoil from the self-hammering action causes it to simply bounce in place, which is what the mission team suspects is happening now.</p>\n\n<p>While JPL manages the InSight mission for NASA, the German Aerospace Center (DLR) provided the heat probe, which is part of an instrument called the Heat Flow and Physical Properties Package (<a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/insight/spacecraft/instruments/hp3/\">HP<sup>3</sup></a>). Back in June, the team <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/news/8445/insights-team-tries-new-strategy-to-help-the-mole/?site=insight\">devised a plan</a> to help the heat probe. The mole <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/news/8444/common-questions-about-insights-mole/?site=insight\">wasn't designed to be picked up</a> and relocated once it begins digging. Instead, the <a href=\"https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=7259\">robotic arm</a> <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/news/8455/nasas-insight-uncovers-the-mole/?site=insight\">removed a support structure</a> intended to hold the mole steady as it digs into the Martian surface.</p>\n\n<p>Removing the structure allowed the InSight team to get a better look at the hole that formed around the mole as it hammered. It's possible that the mole has hit a rock, but testing by DLR suggested the issue was soil that clumps together rather than falling around the mole as it hammers. Sure enough, the arm's camera discovered that below the surface appears to be 2 to 4 inches (5 to 10 centimeters) of duricrust, a kind of cemented soil thicker than anything encountered on other Mars missions and different from the soil the mole was designed for.</p>\n\n<p>\"All we know about the soil is what we can see in images InSight sends us,\" said Tilman Spohn, HP<sup>3</sup>'s principal investigator at DLR. \"Since we can't bring the soil to the mole, maybe we can bring the mole to the soil by pinning it in the hole.\"</p>\n\n<p>Using a scoop on the robotic arm, the team <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NASAInSight/status/1162419651139133440\" target=\"_blank\">poked and pushed</a> the soil seven times over the summer in an effort to collapse the hole. No such luck. It shouldn&rsquo;t take much force to collapse the hole, but the arm isn't pushing at full strength. The team placed HP<sup>3</sup> as far from the lander as possible so that the spacecraft's shadow wouldn't influence the heat probe's temperature readings. As a result, the arm, which wasn't intended to be used this way, has to stretch out and press at an angle, exerting much less force than if the mole were closer.</p>\n\n<p>\"We're asking the arm to punch above its weight,\" said Ashitey Trebi-Ollennu, the lead arm engineer at JPL. \"The arm can't push the soil the way a person can. This would be easier if it could, but that's just not the arm we have.\"</p>\n\n<p>Interplanetary rescue operations aren't new to NASA. The Mars Exploration Rover team helped save Spirit and Opportunity on more than one occasion. Coming up with workable solutions requires an extraordinary amount of patience and planning. JPL has a working replica of InSight to practice arm movements, and it has a working model of the heat probe as well.</p>\n\n<p>Besides pinning, the team is also testing a technique to use the scoop in the way it was originally intended to work: scraping soil into the hole rather than trying to compress it. Both techniques might be visible to the public in <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/insight/multimedia/raw-images/\">raw images</a> that come down from InSight in the near future.</p>\n\n<p><b>About InSight</b></p>\n\n<p>JPL manages InSight for NASA's Science Mission Directorate.

Granted, you'll need superhuman hearing, but NASA's InSight lander comes equipped with a very special \"ear.\"</p>\n\n<p>The spacecraft's exquisitely sensitive seismometer, called the <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/insight/mission/instruments/seis/\">Seismic Experiment for Interior Structure</a> (SEIS), can pick up vibrations as subtle as a breeze. The instrument was provided by the French space agency, Centre National d'&Eacute;tudes Spatiales (CNES), and its partners.</p>\n\n<p>SEIS was designed to listen for marsquakes. Scientists want to study how the seismic waves of these quakes move through the planet's interior, revealing the deep inner structure of Mars for the first time.</p>\n\n<p>But after the seismometer was <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/news/8407/insights-seismometer-now-has-a-cozy-shelter-on-mars/?site=insight\">set down by InSight's robotic arm</a>, Mars seemed shy. It didn't produce its first rumbling until <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/news/8430/nasas-insight-detects-first-likely-quake-on-mars/?site=insight\">this past April</a>, and this first quake turned out to be an odd duck. It had a surprisingly high-frequency seismic signal compared to what the science team has heard since then. Out of more than 100 events detected to date, about 21 are strongly considered to be quakes. The remainder could be quakes as well, but the science team hasn't ruled out other causes.</p>\n\n<p><b>Quakes</b></p>\n\n<p>Put on headphones to listen to two of the more representative quakes SEIS has detected. These occurred on May 22, 2019 (the 173rd Martian day, or sol, of the mission) and July 25, 2019 (Sol 235). Far below the human range of hearing, these sonifications from SEIS had to be speeded up and slightly processed to be audible through headphones. Both were recorded by the \"very broad band sensors\" on SEIS, which are more sensitive at lower frequencies than its short period sensors.</p>\n\n<p>The Sol 173 quake is about a magnitude 3.7; the Sol 235 quake is about a magnitude 3.3.</p>\n\n<p><span><b>Quake Sol 173</b>: </span><div class='audio_embed column-width'>\n<audio controls> <source src=\"/system/internal_resources/details/original/834_Quake_Sol_173.wav\" type=\"audio/wav\"> Your browser does not support the audio element. </audio>\n</div></p>\n\n<p><b>Quake Sol 235:</b><span> <div class='audio_embed column-width'>\n<audio controls> <source src=\"/system/internal_resources/details/original/835_Quake_Sol_235.wav\" type=\"audio/wav\"> Your browser does not support the audio element. </audio>\n</div></span></p>\n\n<p>Each quake is a subtle rumble. The Sol 235 quake becomes particularly bass-heavy toward the end of the event. Both suggest that the Martian crust is like a mix of the Earth's crust and the Moon's. Cracks in Earth's crust seal over time as water fills them with new minerals. This enables sound waves to continue uninterrupted as they pass through old fractures. Drier crusts like the Moon's remain fractured after impacts, scattering sound waves for tens of minutes rather than allowing them to travel in a straight line. Mars, with its cratered surface, is slightly more Moon-like, with seismic waves ringing for a minute or so, whereas quakes on Earth can come and go in seconds.</p>\n\n<p><b>Mechanical Sounds and Wind Gusts</b></p>\n\n<p>SEIS has no trouble identifying quiet quakes, but its sensitive ear means scientists have lots of other noises to filter out. Over time, the team has learned to recognize the different sounds. And while some are trickier than others to spot, they all have made InSight's presence on Mars feel more real to those working with the spacecraft.</p>\n\n<p>\"It's been exciting, especially in the beginning, hearing the first vibrations from the lander,\" said Constantinos Charalambous, an InSight science team member at Imperial College London who works with the SP sensors. \"You're imagining what's really happening on Mars as InSight sits on the open landscape.\"</p>\n\n<p>Charalambous and Nobuaki Fuji of Institut de Physique du Globe de Paris provided the audio samples for this story, including the one below, which is also best heard with headphones and captures the array of sounds they're hearing.  </p>\n\n<figure class='column-width embedded_video video_player_container'>\n<div class='video_wrapper'>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/m9cCuW9nIQg\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div>\n<figcaption>\n<b>Listen to NASA's InSight at Work on Mars</b>: NASA's InSight lander placed a seismometer on the Martian surface to study marsquakes.Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n<p>On March 6, 2019, a camera on InSight's robotic arm was scanning the surface in front of the lander. Each movement of the arm produces what to SEIS is a piercing noise.</p>\n\n<p>Wind gusts can also create noise. The team is always on the hunt for quakes, but they've found the twilight hours are one of the best times to do so. During the day, sunlight warms the air and creates more wind interference than at night.</p>\n\n<p>Evening is also when peculiar sounds that the InSight team has nicknamed \"dinks and donks\" become more prevalent. The team knows they're coming from delicate parts within the seismometer expanding and contracting against one another and thinks heat loss may be the factor, similar to how a car engine \"ticks\" after it's turned off and begins cooling.</p>\n\n<p>You can hear a number of these dinks and donks in this next set of sounds, recorded just after sundown on July 16, 2019 (Sol 226).

More than 300 citizens and students of Jezero and two adjacent municipalities, Jajce and Mrkonji\u0107 Grad, shared their enthusiasm for the mission during the event with the U.S. Embassy and U.S. Army Civil Affairs team. Students from both schools performed a play, \"We Are Going to Mars,\" and experimented with robots provided by the U.S. Embassy.</p>\n\n<p>\"Part of NASA's mission is to inspire scientists, engineers and explorers,\" said Lori Glaze, director of the Planetary Science Division at NASA Headquarters in Washington. \"Jezero's connection with the Mars 2020 mission may very well inspire students in Jezero, and elsewhere in Bosnia and Herzegovina, to pursue an education in the sciences.\"</p>\n\n<p>Mars 2020 will launch from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida in July of 2020.
