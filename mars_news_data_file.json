It's been over a month since engineers have heard from MarCO, which followed NASA's InSight to the Red Planet. At this time, the mission team considers it unlikely they'll be heard from again.</p>\n\n<p>MarCO, short for Mars Cube One, was the first interplanetary mission to use a class of mini-spacecraft called <a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/news/834/10-things-cubesats-going-farther/\" target=\"_blank\">CubeSats</a>. The MarCOs &mdash; nicknamed EVE and WALL-E, after characters from a Pixar film &mdash; served as communications relays during InSight's landing, beaming back data at each stage of its descent to the Martian surface in near-real time, along with <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/resources/22159/insights-first-image-from-mars/?site=insight\">InSight's first image</a>. WALL-E sent back <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/news/8394/nasa-hears-marco-cubesats-loud-and-clear-from-mars/?site=insight\">stunning images</a> of Mars as well, while EVE performed some simple radio science.</p>\n\n<p>All of this was achieved with experimental technology that cost a fraction of what most space missions do: $18.5 million provided by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, which built the CubeSats.</p>\n\n<p>WALL-E was last heard from on Dec. 29; EVE, on Jan. 4. Based on trajectory calculations, WALL-E is currently more than 1 million miles (1.6 million kilometers) past Mars; EVE is farther, almost 2 million miles (3.2 million kilometers) past Mars.</p>\n\n<p>The mission team has several theories for why they haven't been able to contact the pair. WALL-E has a leaky thruster. Attitude-control issues could be causing them to wobble and lose the ability to send and receive commands. The brightness sensors that allow the CubeSats to stay pointed at the Sun and recharge their batteries could be another factor. The MarCOs are in orbit around the Sun and will only get farther away as February wears on. The farther they are, the more precisely they need to point their antennas to communicate with Earth.</p>\n\n<p>The MarCOs won't start moving toward the Sun again until this summer. The team will reattempt to contact the CubeSats at that time, though it's anyone's guess whether their batteries and other parts will last that long.</p>\n\n<p>Even if they're never revived, the team considers MarCO a spectacular success.</p>\n\n<p>\"This mission was always about pushing the limits of miniaturized technology and seeing just how far it could take us,\" said Andy Klesh, the mission's chief engineer at JPL. \"We've put a stake in the ground. Future CubeSats might go even farther.\"</p>\n\n<p>A number of the critical spare parts for each MarCO will be used in other CubeSat missions. That includes their experimental radios, antennas and propulsion systems. Several of these systems were provided by commercial vendors, making it easier for other CubeSats to use them as well.</p>\n\n<p>More small spacecraft are on the way. NASA is set to launch a variety of new CubeSats in coming years.</p>\n\n<p>\"There's big potential in these small packages,\" said John Baker, the MarCO program manager at JPL. \"CubeSats &mdash; part of a larger group of spacecraft called SmallSats &mdash; are a new platform for space exploration that is affordable to more than just government agencies.\"</p>\n\n<p>For more information, visit:<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/cubesat/missions/marco.php\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/cubesat/missions/marco.php</a></p>\n\n<p><b>News Relations Contact</b></p>\n\n<p>Andrew Good<br />\nJet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif.<br />\n818-393-2433<br />\n<a href=\"mailto:andrew.c.good@jpl.nasa.gov\">andrew.c.good@jpl.nasa.gov</a></p>\n\n<p>JoAnna Wendel<br />\nHeadquarters, Washington<br />\n202-358-1003<br />\n<a href=\"mailto:Joanna.r.wendel@nasa.gov\">Joanna.r.wendel@nasa.gov</a></p>\n", "thumb": "/system/news_items/list_view_images/8408_22206_PIA22655-th.gif", "main_image": "/system/news_items/main_images/8408_22206_PIA22655.gif", "status": 1}, {"id": 8616, "title": "Sol 2688-2689: Into the Unknown", "target": "_self", "main_image_alt": "This image was taken by Left Navigation Camera onboard NASA's Mars rover Curiosity on Sol 2664.", "meta_author": "Abigail Fraeman", "byline": "", "meta_keywords": "drill, Hutton, drive, rover, Greenheugh", "item_name": "", "updated_at": "2020-02-27T02:51:33.527Z", "url": "/msl/mission-updates/8616/sol-2688-2689-into-the-unknown/", "missions": [[175, "mep", "Mars Exploration Program"], [176, "msl", "Mars Science Laboratory"]], "news_type": [[185, "mission_updates", "Mission Updates "]], "description": "Over the last couple of weeks, the Curiosity science team engaged in a series of long debates about where we should go after we completed our analyses of the Hutton sample.

We&rsquo;d always planned to drive on top of the Greenheugh pediment at some point, but the rover wouldn&rsquo;t reach the access points identified from orbit for months, or possibly even years. However, while Curiosity was completing the drill campaign at Hutton, rover drivers working with surface properties scientists discovered a potentially passible route onto the top of the <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/raw_images/773851/?site=msl\">Greenheugh pediment</a> that was accessible from our current location. So as a team we had to consider, were the science benefits worth trying to drive onto the pediment now, or we should wait until later as originally planned? In the end, we decided the science rationale to ascend now were so compelling, it was worth going for it.</p>\n\n<p>The focus of today&rsquo;s plan will be to execute the first of several drives that will take us to the top.  We don&rsquo;t expect to encounter slopes much greater than 25\u02da in today&rsquo;s planned drive, but subsequent drives will require the rover to ascend slopes of 30\u02da or more.  We&rsquo;ve never driven up slopes this steep with Curiosity before, and we don&rsquo;t actually know if the rover will be able to make it all the way up and over.  However, all of our analysis shows this attempt won&rsquo;t put any unusual risk on the vehicle hardware, so there&rsquo;s no reason we can&rsquo;t try! </p>\n\n<p>Exploring Mars is always exciting, but for me, this has been a particularly fun and exciting time to be a part of the Curiosity science team. I love the feeling of exploring and venturing into the unknown. We don&rsquo;t know if we&rsquo;ll be able to make it onto the pediment capping unit here, but we know we&rsquo;ll discover something completely new if we do reach the top. </p>\n", "thumb": "/system/news_items/list_view_images/8616_NLB_633993124EDR_F0790000NCAM00289M_-320x240.jpg", "main_image": "/system/news_items/main_images/8616_NLB_633993124EDR_F0790000NCAM00289M_.jpg", "status": 1}, {"id": 8615, "title": "Sol 2686-2687: The Tail End of the Hutton Drill Campaign", "target": "_self", "main_image_alt": "Studying drill \"tailings,\" gray material surrounding the drill hole.

Among its science tools are a seismometer for detecting quakes, sensors for gauging wind and air pressure, a magnetometer, and a heat flow probe designed to take the planet's temperature.</p>\n\n<p>While the team continues to work on <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/news/8612/mars-insight-lander-to-push-on-top-of-the-mole/?site=insight\">getting the probe into the Martian surface</a> as intended, the ultra-sensitive seismometer, called the Seismic Experiment for Interior Structure (<a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/insight/mission/instruments/seis/\">SEIS</a>), has enabled scientists to \"hear\" multiple trembling events from hundreds to thousands of miles away.</p>\n\n<p>Seismic waves are affected by the materials they move through, giving scientists a way to study the composition of the planet's inner structure. Mars can help the team better understand how all rocky planets, including Earth, first formed.</p>\n\n<p><b>Underground</b></p>\n\n<p>Mars trembles more often &mdash; but also more mildly &mdash; than expected. SEIS has found more than 450 seismic signals to date, the vast majority of which are probably quakes (as opposed to data noise created by environmental factors, like wind). The largest quake was about magnitude 4.0 in size &mdash; not quite large enough to travel down below the crust into the planet's lower mantle and core. Those are \"the juiciest parts of the apple\" when it comes to studying the planet's inner structure, said Bruce Banerdt, InSight principal investigator at JPL.</p>\n\n<p>Scientists are ready for more: It took months after InSight's landing in November 2018 before they recorded the first seismic event. By the end of 2019, SEIS was detecting about two seismic signals a day, suggesting that InSight just happened to touch down at a particularly quiet time. Scientists still have their fingers crossed for \"the Big One.\"</p>\n\n<div class='column-width image_module' style=''>\n<figure class='inline_figure'>\n<a class='inline_image_enlarge fancybox' href='/system/resources/detail_files/24784_pia23182-InSight-landslide-web.jpg'>\n<img alt=\"Landslides in Mars' Cerberus Fossae\" src='/system/resources/detail_files/24784_pia23182-InSight-landslide-web.jpg'>\n<div class='enlarge_icon'></div>\n</a>\n<figcaption>\n<b>Landslides in Mars' Cerberus Fossae</b>: The two largest quakes detected by NASA's InSight appear to have originated in a region of Mars called Cerberus Fossae.

A pair of quakes was strongly linked to one such region, Cerberus Fossae, where scientists see boulders that may have been shaken down cliffsides. Ancient floods there <a href=\"/resources/24785\">carved channels</a> nearly 800 miles (1,300 kilometers) long. Lava flows then seeped into those channels within the past 10 million years &mdash; the blink of an eye in geologic time.</p>\n\n<p>Some of these young lava flows show signs of having been fractured by quakes less than 2 million years ago. \"It's just about the youngest tectonic feature on the planet,\" said planetary geologist Matt Golombek of JPL. \"The fact that we're seeing evidence of shaking in this region isn't a surprise, but it's very cool.\"</p>\n\n<p><b>At the Surface</b></p>\n\n<p>Billions of years ago, Mars had a magnetic field. It is no longer present, but it left ghosts behind, magnetizing ancient rocks that are now between 200 feet (61 meters) to several miles below ground. InSight is equipped with a magnetometer &mdash; the first on the surface of Mars to detect magnetic signals.</p>\n\n<p>The magnetometer has found that the signals at Homestead hollow are 10 times stronger than what was predicted based on data from orbiting spacecraft that study the area. The measurements of these orbiters are averaged over a couple of hundred miles, whereas InSight's measurements are more local.</p>\n\n<p>Because most surface rocks at InSight's location are too young to have been magnetized by the planet's former field, \"this magnetism must be coming from ancient rocks underground,\" said Catherine Johnson, a planetary scientist at the University of British Columbia and the Planetary Science Institute. \"We're combining these data with what we know from seismology and geology to understand the magnetized layers below InSight. How strong or deep would they have to be for us to detect this field?\"</p>\n\n<p>In addition, scientists are intrigued by how these signals change over time. The measurements vary by day and night; they also tend to pulse around midnight. Theories are still being formed as to what causes such changes, but one possibility is that they're related to the solar wind interacting with the Martian atmosphere.</p>\n\n<p><b>In the Wind</b></p>\n\n<p>InSight measures wind speed, direction and air pressure nearly continuously, offering more data than previous landed missions. The spacecraft's <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/insight/weather/\">weather sensors</a> have detected thousands of passing whirlwinds, which are called dust devils when they pick up grit and become visible. \"This site has more whirlwinds than any other place we've landed on Mars while carrying weather sensors,\" said Aymeric Spiga, an atmospheric scientist at Sorbonne University in Paris.</p>\n\n<p>Despite all that activity and frequent imaging, InSight's cameras have yet to see dust devils. But SEIS can feel these whirlwinds pulling on the surface like a giant vacuum cleaner. \"Whirlwinds are perfect for subsurface seismic exploration,\" said Philippe Lognonn&eacute; of Institut de Physique du Globe de Paris (IPGP), principal investigator of SEIS.</p>\n\n<p><b>Still to Come: The Core</b></p>\n\n<p>InSight has two radios: one for regularly sending and receiving data, and a more powerful radio designed to measure the \"wobble\" of Mars as it spins. This X-band radio, also known as the Rotation and Interior Structure Experiment (RISE), can eventually reveal whether the planet's core is solid or liquid. A solid core would cause Mars to wobble less than a liquid one would.</p>\n\n<p>This first year of data is just a start. Watching over a full Martian year (two Earth years) will give scientists a much better idea of the size and speed of the planet's wobble.</p>\n\n<p><b>About InSight</b></p>\n\n<p>A division of Caltech in Pasadena, JPL manages InSight for NASA's Science Mission Directorate. InSight is part of NASA's Discovery Program, managed by the agency's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama.

The reason for the focus on power is that we are still in the middle of the Hutton drill campaign. This gives us lots of things to do, but power constraints restrict what we can achieve each planning. But, we&rsquo;ll get this all done, we just need to be patient (not this blogger&rsquo;s personal best skill!). The focus of today&rsquo;s planning is to progress with the drill activities, mainly dealing with the remainder of the portioning and then dumping the samples and getting APXS overnight on it. There was a lot of discussion how to play that &lsquo;power tetris&rsquo; once again.</p>\n\n<p>And we now have a lot in the plan! First, arm movements are required to carry out further portioning of the sample, and then dump the sample. Mastcam, APXS and MAHLI are documenting the chemistry and textures of the dump pile.</p>\n\n<p>Documenting the area far and near is one of the priorities for ChemCam and Mastcam. There are two RMI mosaics to document the buttes around us, named &ldquo;South Esk 2&rdquo; and &ldquo;Glenrothes 2,&rdquo; and there is a further RMI mosaic, named &ldquo;Moray Firth.&rdquo; The latter is especially looking at the capping material of the butte &ndash; and the contact to the underlying rocks. All those images will serve to investigate the sedimentary features of the area and understand if wind or wate rformed these rocks. With the opportunity to image the buttes from three dimensions, there is great opportunity to get behind all the details.</p>\n\n<p>Mastcam is joining the imaging campaign, with one single frame stereo image to join previous mosaics, and two mosaics: a 9x1 of the target &ldquo;Craiglaw Point,&rdquo; which is to document the sedimentary structures at this location.

The mission team plans to command the scoop on InSight's robotic arm to press down on the \"mole,\" the mini pile driver designed to hammer itself as much as 16 feet (5 meters) down.

While burrowing into the soil, it is designed to drag with it a ribbonlike tether that extends from the spacecraft.

The InSight team has since determined that the soil here is different than what has been encountered on other parts of Mars. InSight landed in an area with an unusually thick duricrust, or a layer of cemented soil. Rather than being loose and sandlike, as expected, the dirt granules stick together.</p>\n\n<p>The mole needs friction from soil in order to travel downward; without it, recoil from its self-hammering action causes it to simply bounce in place. Ironically, loose soil, not duricrust, provides that friction as it falls around the mole.</p>\n\n<p>This past summer, the InSight team started using the robotic arm's scoop to press on the side of the mole, a technique called \"pinning\" that added just enough friction to help it dig without coming in contact with the fragile science tether connected to the mole's back cap.   </p>\n\n<p>While pinning helped, the mole popped back out of the Martian soil on two occasions, possibly from soil building up from beneath. With few alternatives left, the team has decided to try helping the mole dig by carefully pressing on its back cap while attempting to avoid the tether.</p>\n\n<p>It might take several tries to perfect the back-cap push, just as pinning did. Throughout late February and early March, InSight's arm will be maneuvered into position so that the team can test what happens as the mole briefly hammers.</p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, the team is also considering using the scoop to move more soil into the hole that has formed around the mole. This could add more pressure and friction, allowing it to finally dig down. Whether they pursue this route depends on how deep the mole is able to travel after the back-cap push.</p>\n\n<p><b>About InSight</b></p>\n\n<p>JPL manages InSight for NASA's Science Mission Directorate.

To guard against corruption of the flash memory itself, multiple copies of essential parameters are stored onboard.</p>\n\n<p>To keep both of the redundant computers up to date, engineers will update the flash on the Side-A computer first and then command a Side-A reboot to ensure that the flash memory was properly updated. Once they confirm the changes have taken effect, they'll swap to Side-B and repeat the process. </p>\n\n<p>After validation of the memory updates, MRO will return to its science and relay-support activities.

Part of the Deep Space Network (DSN), the 112-foot-wide (34-meter-wide) antenna dish being built represents a future in which more missions will require advanced technology, such as lasers capable of transmitting vast amounts of data from astronauts on the Martian surface. As part of its <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/artemisprogram\">Artemis program</a> NASA will send the first woman and next man to the Moon by 2024, applying lessons learned there to send astronauts to Mars.</p>\n\n<p>Using massive antenna dishes, the agency talks to more than 30 deep space missions on any given day, including many international missions. As more missions have launched and with more in the works, NASA is looking to strengthen the network. When completed in 2&frac12; years, the new dish will be christened Deep Space Station-23 (DSS-23), bringing the DSN's number of operational antennas to 13.</p>\n\n<p>\"Since the 1960s, when the world first watched live pictures of humans in space and on the Moon, to revealing imagery and scientific data from the surface of Mars and vast, distant galaxies, the Deep Space Network has connected humankind with our solar system and beyond,\" said Badri Younes, NASA's deputy associate administrator for Space Communications and Navigation, or SCaN, which oversees NASA's networks. \"This new antenna, the fifth of six currently planned, is another example of NASA's determination to enable science and space exploration through the use of the latest technology.\"</p>\n\n<p>Managed by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, the world's largest and busiest deep space network is clustered in three locations - Goldstone, California; Madrid, Spain; and Canberra, Australia - that are positioned approximately 120 degrees apart around the globe to enable continual contact with spacecraft as the Earth rotates. (<a href=\"https://eyes.nasa.gov/dsn/\" target=\"_blank\">This live tool</a> lets viewers see which DSN dishes are sending up commands or receiving data at any given time.)</p>\n\n<p>The first addition to Goldstone since 2003, the new dish is being built at the complex's Apollo site, so named because its DSS-16 antenna supported NASA's human missions to the Moon. Similar antennas have been built in recent years in Canberra, while two are under construction in Madrid.</p>\n\n<p>\"The DSN is Earth's one phone line to our two Voyager spacecraft - both in interstellar space - all our Mars missions and the New Horizons spacecraft that is now far past Pluto,\" said JPL Deputy Director Larry James. \"The more we explore, the more antennas we need to talk to all our missions.\"</p>\n\n<p>While DSS-23 will function as a radio antenna, it will also be equipped with mirrors and a special receiver for lasers beamed from distant spacecraft. This technology is critical for sending astronauts to places like Mars. Humans there will need to communicate with Earth more than NASA's robotic explorers do, and a Mars base, with its life support systems and equipment, would buzz with data that needs to be monitored.</p>\n\n<p>\"Lasers can increase your data rate from Mars by about 10 times what you get from radio,\" said Suzanne Dodd, director of the Interplanetary Network, the organization that manages the DSN. \"Our hope is that providing a platform for optical communications will encourage other space explorers to experiment with lasers on future missions.\"</p>\n\n<p>While clouds can disrupt lasers, Goldstone's clear desert skies make it an ideal location to serve as a laser receiver about 60% of the time. A demonstration of DSS-23's capabilities is around the corner: When NASA launches an orbiter called Psyche to a metallic asteroid in a few years, it will carry an experimental laser communications terminal developed by JPL. Called the Deep Space Optical Communications project, this equipment will send data and images to an observatory at Southern California's Palomar Mountain. But Psyche will also be able to communicate with the new Goldstone antenna, paving the way for higher data rates in deep space.</p>\n\n<p>For more information:</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><a href=\"https://deepspace.jpl.nasa.gov/\"><b>https://deepspace.jpl.nasa.gov/</b></a></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/directorates/heo/scan/index.html\"><b>https://www.nasa.gov/directorates/heo/scan/index.html</b></a></p>\n\n<p>Andrew Good<br />\nJet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif.<br />\n818-393-2433<br />\n<a href=\"mailto:andrew.c.good@jpl.nasa.gov\">andrew.c.good@jpl.nasa.gov</a></p>\n\n<p>Kathryn Hambleton<br />\nNASA Headquarters, Washington<br />\n202-358-1100<br />\n<a href=\"mailto:kathryn.hambleton@nasa.gov\">kathryn.hambleton@nasa.gov</a></p>\n", "thumb": "/system/news_items/list_view_images/8606_list_image.jpg", "main_image": "/assets/public/missing.png", "status": 1}, {"id": 8604, "title": "Sol 2672: Continuing to Explore Hutton", "target": "_self", "main_image_alt": "This image was taken by Left Navigation Camera onboard NASA's Mars rover Curiosity on Sol 2665.", "meta_author": "Mariah Baker", "byline": "", "meta_keywords": "", "item_name": "https://mars.nasa.gov/msl-raw-images/proj/msl/redops/ods/surface/sol/02665/opgs/edr/ncam/NLB_634077781EDR_F0790000NCAM00353M_.jpg", "updated_at": "2020-02-11T21:48:01.361Z", "url": "/msl/mission-updates/8604/sol-2672-continuing-to-explore-hutton/", "missions": [[175, "mep", "Mars Exploration Program"], [176, "msl", "Mars Science Laboratory"]], "news_type": [[185, "mission_updates", "Mission Updates "]], "description": "The Curiosity rover is currently located at Hutton, where she successfully completed her 24th drill last week.", "date": "February 11, 2020", "body": "<p>\u200b<span>The Curiosity rover is currently located at Hutton, where she successfully completed her </span><a href=\"http://mars.nasa.gov/msl/mission-updates/8602/sols-2669-2671-successful-drill-at-hutton/\">24th drill last week</a><span>.

It fires a pulsed laser beam out of the rover's mast, or \"head,\" to vaporize small portions of rock from a distance, providing information that will be essential to the mission's success.</p>\n\n<p>Here's a closer look at what makes the instrument so special:</p>\n\n<p><b>A Far Reach</b></p>\n\n<p>Using a laser beam will help researchers identify minerals that are beyond the reach of the rover's robotic arm or in areas too steep for the rover to go. It will also enable them to analyze a target before deciding whether to guide the rover there for further analysis. Of particular interest: minerals that formed in the presence of liquid water, like clays, carbonates and sulfates. Liquid water is essential to the existence of life as we know it, including microbes, which could have survived on Mars billions of years ago.</p>\n\n<p>Scientists can also use the information from SuperCam to help decide whether to capture rock cores for the rover's sample caching system. Mars 2020 will collect these core samples in metal tubes, eventually depositing them at a predetermined location for a future mission to retrieve and bring back to Earth.</p>\n\n<figure class='column-width embedded_video video_player_container'>\n<div class='video_wrapper'>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/-rvWXCts420\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div>\n<figcaption>\n<b>SuperCam's Laser Zaps</b>: NASA's Mars 2020 will include a laser instrument, called SuperCam, capable of vaporizing rock material and studying its composition. In a test shown here, the SuperCam Mast Unit &mdash; which sits in the mast, or \"head,\" of the rover &mdash; zaps marks across a piece of metal. The popping sound of each laser zap will be recorded on Mars by a microphone installed along with SuperCam. Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n<p><b>Laser Focus</b></p>\n\n<p>SuperCam is essentially a next-generation version of the <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/msl/home/\">Curiosity</a> rover's ChemCam. Like its predecessor, SuperCam can use an infrared laser beam to heat the material it impacts to around 18,000 degrees Fahrenheit (10,000 degrees Celsius) &mdash; a method called laser induced breakdown spectroscopy, or LIBS &mdash; and vaporizes it. A special camera can then determine the chemical makeup of these rocks from the plasma that is created.</p>\n\n<p>Just like ChemCam, SuperCam will use <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/news/2885/laser-targeting-ai-yields-more-mars-science/?site=msl\">artificial intelligence</a> to seek out rock targets worth zapping during and after drives, when humans are out of the loop. In addition, this upgraded A.I. lets SuperCam point very precisely at small rock features.</p>\n\n<p>Another new feature in SuperCam is a green laser that can determine the molecular composition of surface materials. This green beam excites the chemical bonds in a sample and produces a signal depending on which elements are bonded together &mdash; a technique called Raman spectroscopy. SuperCam also uses the green laser to cause some minerals and carbon-based chemicals to emit light, or fluoresce.</p>\n\n<p>Minerals and organic chemicals fluoresce at different rates, so SuperCam's light sensor features a shutter that can close as quickly as 100 nanoseconds at a time &mdash; so fast that very few photons of light will enter it. Altering the shutter speed (a technique called time-resolved luminescence spectroscopy) will enable scientists to better determine the compounds present.</p>\n\n<p>Moreover, SuperCam can use visible and infrared (VISIR) light reflected from the Sun to study the mineral content of rocks and sediments. This VISIR technique complements the Raman spectroscopy; each technique is sensitive to different types of minerals.</p>\n\n<div class='column-width image_module' style=''>\n<figure class='inline_figure'>\n<a href='/resources/24758/supercams-mast-unit-being-tested-at-los-alamos-national-laboratory/' target='_self'>\n<img alt=\"SuperCam's Mast Unit Being Tested at Los Alamos National Laboratory\" src='/system/resources/detail_files/24758_PIA23620-web.jpg'>\n</a>\n<figcaption>\n<b>SuperCam's Mast Unit Being Tested</b>: The Mast Unit for Mars 2020's SuperCam, shown being tested here, will use a laser to vaporize and study rock material on the Red Planet's surface.

The popping sound created by the laser subtly changes depending on a rock's material properties.</p>\n\n<p>\"The microphone serves a practical purpose by telling us something about our rock targets from a distance. But we can also use it to directly record the sound of the Martian landscape or the rover's mast swiveling,\" said Sylvestre Maurice of the Institute for Research in Astrophysics and Planetary Science in Toulouse, France.</p>\n\n<p>The Mars 2020 rover marks the third time this particular microphone design will go to the Red Planet, Maurice said. In the late 1990s, the same design rode aboard the Mars Polar Lander, which crashed on the surface. In 2008, the Phoenix mission experienced electronics issues that prevented the microphone from being used.</p>\n\n<p>In the case of Mars 2020, SuperCam doesn't have the only microphone aboard the rover: <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/mission/technology/entry-descent-landing/#EDL-Cameras-Microphone\">an entry, descent and landing microphone</a> will capture all the sounds of the car-sized rover making its way to the surface. It will add audio to full-color video recorded by the rover&rsquo;s cameras, capturing a Mars landing like never before.</p>\n\n<p><b>Teamwork</b></p>\n\n<p>SuperCam is led by Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico, where the instrument's Body Unit was developed. That part of the instrument includes several spectrometers, control electronics and software.</p>\n\n<p>The Mast Unit was developed and built by several laboratories of the CNRS (French research center) and French universities under the contracting authority of CNES (French space agency).

The issue with (1) was that, while the drive over the weekend left Curiosity in front of a very interesting outcrop, it also left the rover with significant tilt. So it was initially unclear whether we would pass the Slip Risk Assessment Process (SRAP), as required to be able to drill here. For this reason, both the GEO (geology) and ENV (environmental) science theme groups had to come up with a few different plans! Due to power and other constraints, the science block was only 37 minutes long, which didn&rsquo;t leave enough time to do ChemCam activities as well as everything else. However, this location is of great interest for ChemCam because it&rsquo;s close to the contact between the Greenheugh Pediment and Murray formation, hence chemical analysis could reveal important information on processes affecting the rocks immediately beneath Mount Sharp&rsquo;s capping unit. </p>\n\n<p>The ENV group and Mastcam therefore agreed to give up all of our activities to ChemCam if we were going to immediately drive away (option 3). If, however, we were going to stay put or &lsquo;bump&rsquo; (options 1 and 2), we decided that ENV and Mastcam activities would take up all of the time, leaving the ChemCam activities until a later sol. Even then, the science activities varied depending on whether we stayed put or moved a little. For example, ENV dust devil movies are ideally taken during a period with REMS coverage, because we can then compare any imaged dust devils (dusty vortices) with measurements of vortex pressure drops made by REMS. The &lsquo;stay put&rsquo; plan (option 1) had the science block at about 2pm local true solar time on Mars, which was covered by REMS; however, the &lsquo;bump&rsquo; plan (option 2) had the science block earlier, during a period with no REMS coverage. So if we went with option 2, we would have pulled the dust devil movie to make room for other activities.</p>\n\n<p>In the end, we discovered at the start of the SOWG meeting that the rover had passed SRAP and we would be staying put to drill (option 1). We therefore stuck with our bevy of ENV and GEO Mastcam activities. For ENV, these included a Suprahorizon cloud movie (looking for clouds above the north crater rim), a Navcam dust devil movie, and a Navcam &lsquo;line of sight&rsquo; measurement of the dustiness across the crater. ENV activities were somewhat limited, as many of them rely on being able to image some distance away (e.g. to look for dust devils in all directions or to look for cloud shadows on Mount Sharp), whereas we are surrounded by high topography in many directions at this location (e.g. see image). For GEO, activities included APXS of the potential drill target &ldquo;Hutton,&rdquo; followed by a DRT (to remove dust) then a center and offset APXS on the potential drill spot, as well as a Mastcam mosaic of the top of &ldquo;Tower Butte&rdquo; to document sedimentologic structures, a Mastcam observation of a light-toned target named &ldquo;Dumfriesshire,&rdquo; and finally Mastcam on a on a portion of the bedrock that had been scuffed by the rover&rsquo;s wheel, to look for surface changes. The latter will be used to infer wind strength and direction at our current location, which is valuable both for comparison with Mars atmospheric models and to determine the risk of drill samples being blown away.</p>\n", "thumb": "/system/news_items/list_view_images/8598_NLB_633993481EDR_S0790000NCAM00290M_-320x240.jpg", "main_image": "/system/news_items/main_images/8598_NLB_633993481EDR_S0790000NCAM00290M_.jpg", "status": 1}, {"id": 8597, "title": "Sol 2662-2664: Contact Science at a Record Setting Tilt", "target": "_self", "main_image_alt": "View of the martian terrain, tilted.", "meta_author": "Abigail Fraeman", "byline": "", "meta_keywords": "Mars,tilt,Curiosity,Rover,bedrock,chemistry,rocks,drive", "item_name": "https://mars.nasa.gov/msl-raw-images/proj/msl/redops/ods/surface/sol/02661/opgs/edr/ncam/NLB_633723990EDR_F0782858NCAM00284M_.JPG", "updated_at": "2020-02-03T16:57:45.052Z", "url": "/msl/mission-updates/8597/sol-2662-2664-contact-science-at-a-record-setting-tilt/", "missions": [[175, "mep", "Mars Exploration Program"], [176, "msl", "Mars Science Laboratory"]], "news_type": [[185, "mission_updates", "Mission Updates "]], "description": "Curiosity is near the contact between the clay-bearing \u201cGlen Torridon\u201d unit and the \u201cGreenheugh\u201d pediment, and the rover is parked at a mission-record setting 26.9\u02da tilt!", "date": "February  3, 2020", "body": "<p>Curiosity is near the contact between the clay-bearing &ldquo;Glen Torridon&rdquo; unit and the &ldquo;Greenheugh&rdquo; pediment, and the rover is parked at a mission-record setting 26.9\u02da tilt!

Recent measurements from one of these instruments detected unexpected sudden spikes in the abundance of plasma as it flew through the Martian ionosphere. Joe Grebowsky, former MAVEN project scientist at NASA Goddard, immediately recognized the spike from his previous experience with rocket flights through the layers at Earth. Not only had MAVEN discovered that such layers can occur at other planets than Earth, but the new results reveal that Mars offers what Earth cannot, a place where we can reliably explore these layers with satellites.</p>\n\n<p><div class='column-width image_module' style=''>\n<figure class='inline_figure'>\n<a href='/resources/24756/artists-concept-of-maven-encountering-plasma-layers-at-mars/' target='_self'>\n<img alt='Graphic illustrating the MAVEN spacecraft encountering plasma layers at Mars.' src='/system/resources/detail_files/24756_mavenatmars-web.jpg'>\n</a>\n<figcaption>\nGraphic illustrating the MAVEN spacecraft encountering plasma layers at Mars.<br />\nCredits: NASA Goddard/CI lab<br />\n<a href=\"/resources/24756/artists-concept-of-maven-encountering-plasma-layers-at-mars/\">Download image &rsaquo;</a>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>&ldquo;The low altitudes observable by MAVEN will fill in a great gap in our understanding of this region on both Mars and Earth, with really significant discoveries to be had,&rdquo; says Grebowsky, a co-author on the paper.</p>\n\n<p>MAVEN observations are already overturning many of our existing ideas about the phenomena: MAVEN has discovered that the layers also have a mirror-opposite, a &ldquo;rift&rdquo;, where plasma is less abundant. The existence of such &ldquo;rifts&rdquo; in nature was completely unknown before their discovery at Mars by MAVEN, and overturns existing scientific models which say they cannot form. Additionally, unlike at Earth where the layers are short-lived and unpredictable, the Martian layers are surprisingly long-lived and persistent.</p>\n\n<p>These new discoveries already have given us a better understanding of the fundamental processes that underpin these layers, and future exploration at Mars will allow us to build better scientific models of how they form. While, much like the weather, we cannot stop them from forming, perhaps someday the new insights from Mars may help us to forecast them at Earth, meaning more reliable radio communication for us all.</p>\n\n<p>This research was funded by the MAVEN mission. MAVEN's principal investigator is based at the University of Colorado's Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics, and NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, manages the MAVEN project. Partner institutions include Lockheed Martin, the University of California at Berkeley, and NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

The rocks around us were a riot of shapes, colors and textures, making it difficult to limit ourselves to which ones we would look at. The image above captures the six (yes, six!) targets we managed to fit in the plan today. The team is trying to understand how (or if) the bedrock chemistry changes as we move closer to the Greenheugh pediment, as the pediment marks a change in rock type from the majority of rocks we have encountered through the clay-bearing &ldquo;Glen Torridon&rdquo; unit. As such, many of our targets were dedicated to the bedrock today. MAHLI and APXS will analyze &ldquo;Cullivoe&rdquo; and &ldquo;Bogmill Pow,&rdquo; the former after it has been brushed by the DRT. Cullivoe represents the flatter, smoother areas of the bedrock free of veins or other erosion-resistant features while Bogmill Pow is one of the rough, multicolored areas of the bedrock. ChemCam will analyze a similarly complementary pair of targets. The goal is for &ldquo;High Possil&rdquo; to represent the background bedrock in this area, while &ldquo;Duncairn&rdquo; specifically focuses on an erosion-resistant feature that appears to be emerging from its host bedrock. Veins were a particularly spectacular feature of the workspace, often exhibiting white interiors and thin, gray exteriors. The most notable example is the bright, linear feature in the center of the image, given the name &ldquo;Tilicoultry,&rdquo; with a gray slab broken off and sitting on the sand to the right of the vein, named &ldquo;Hastigrow.&rdquo; This pair, and the bedrock and sand surrounding them, will be imaged using the Mastcam multispectral technique, which ought to help uncover the differences among the bedrock and the parts of the vein. </span></p>\n\n<p>Curiosity will intersperse observations of the sky among all those of the ground. Mastcam will acquire early morning images to measure the dust load in the atmosphere, and Navcam will acquire late afternoon movies to look for clouds and dust devils. RAD and REMS maintain their steady watch of the weather and radiation environment in Gale, and DAN will seek signals of hydrogen from under the rover both before and after we drive. Yes, as hard as it will be to leave this spot, higher elevations call! We will drive to the highest accessible bedrock exposure just below the pediment in hopes that we can interrogate its chemistry over the weekend.

We are at a very interesting point with potential changes in rock chemistry. That always gets the geochemists like me to sit up and pay extra attention. But we don&rsquo;t always get it our way, because other investigations are just as important. Today&rsquo;s plan is a two-sol plan with the third day being a soliday, which did not make it any easier. As the Science Operations Working Group chair put it: &ldquo;This plan is a two-sol plan, but it surely doesn&rsquo;t feel like it with all the details!&rdquo; So, we waited anxiously for the plan to be combined from all the fragments and get the engineering judgement on power. Unfortunately, and despite serious efforts that reminded me of trying to play Tetris and Sudoku in the same game, the power available was not enough to get it all done. In a case like this, careful considerations are required regarding what observations are specific to the location or the time, and which ones could wait for the next plan. It was the ENV group, who today gave up an observation to make it all fit, but retains the crater rim extinction and the full tau observation.</p>\n\n<p>From a geochemist&rsquo;s perspective the most interesting part of the story at the current location is that we see two different types of bedrock. One is characterized in the images by a smoother appearance and veins in it. This type is the primary focus on the plan. But there is nodular bedrock, too. APXS has the smoother bedrock in reach and will measure the target &ldquo;Rannoch Moore&rdquo; as an evening investigation and &ldquo;Sauchiehall&rdquo; as an overnight, long duration target after DRT. MAHLI will document both targets. ChemCam will investigate &ldquo;Rannoch Moore&rdquo; in conjunction with APXS, and has the targets &ldquo;Janetstown,&rdquo; also on smoother bedrock, and &ldquo;Glenalmond&rdquo; on the nodular version.</p>\n\n<p>At our current location, we have an excellent view of several buttes and the Geenheugh pediment. This is reflected in a very busy plan for Mastcam. The Greenheugh pediment and Tower Butte are images together in a 19x4 mosaic, but there are two more observations with mosaics on Western Butte and the trough feature in front of us. This will allow for detailed analysis of the sediments, but also aid the upcoming drives. Exciting times at a very interesting location!</p>\n\n<p>ENV&rsquo;s activity is a sunset tau, and MARDI, DAN and REMS measurements as well as post-drive imaging complete this very busy plan. In addition to all the observations, Curiosity is set to drive 50 metres &ndash; uphill!

Curiosity evaluates this information before any motor is activated to make sure the movement can be executed safely. When the answer is no - or even maybe not - Curiosity stops without turning the motor. This conservative approach helps keep Curiosity from hitting its arm on rocks, driving over something dangerous, or pointing an unprotected camera at the sun. These safety checks require an accurate knowledge of the rover position within its environment and are an essential part of good engineering practice.

Curiosity kept sending us information, so we know what happened and can develop a recovery plan. That is exactly what we did today: The engineers on the team built a plan to inform Curiosity of its attitude and to confirm what happened. We want Curiosity to recover its ability to make its safety checks, and we also want to know if there is anything we can do to prevent a similar problem in the future. This approach helps keep our rover safe. </span></p>\n", "thumb": "/system/news_items/list_view_images/8587_FLB_632472136EDR_F0781652FHAZ00236M_-320x240.jpg", "main_image": "/system/news_items/main_images/8587_FLB_632472136EDR_F0781652FHAZ00236M_.jpg", "status": 1}, {"id": 8586, "title": "Sols 2645-2646: A Strange Trough on Western Butte", "target": "_self", "main_image_alt": "", "meta_author": "Melissa Rice", "byline": "", "meta_keywords": "Mars, mission, NASA, Curiosity, rover, MAHLI, APXS", "item_name": "https://mars.nasa.gov/msl-raw-images/proj/msl/redops/ods/surface/sol/02643/opgs/edr/ncam/NLB_632127903EDR_F0781442NCAM00264M_.JPG", "updated_at": "2020-01-14T18:00:17.760Z", "url": "/msl/mission-updates/8586/sols-2645-2646-a-strange-trough-on-western-butte/", "missions": [[175, "mep", "Mars Exploration Program"], [176, "msl", "Mars Science Laboratory"]], "news_type": [[185, "mission_updates", "Mission Updates "]], "description": "While descending from Western Butte, Curiosity has stopped to investigate a strange trough along the way.", "date": "January 13, 2020", "body": "<p>While descending from Western Butte, Curiosity has stopped to investigate a strange trough along the way.

The team would like to understand the composition, morphology, and ultimately, the origin of the capping unit of this butte. An image of this capping unit is shown above, taken by the Mastcam M100 camera on Sol 2635. The rocks look really interesting and unusual, but the butte is too steep to drive to the top to sample them. Fortunately, nature is kind to us, and somewhat like humans drop scraps to their pet dog under the table, nature has rolled some samples down to where the rover is.

I gave a presentation within the team today on the first results of those rocks, while the rover makes more observations of them and of other features in the area.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today the team planned two action-packed sols. Our planning session started rather late due to the lateness of the data downlink. This plan is a big opportunity for contact science, as the rover is on stable ground after being for several days with a wheel perched on a rock. Targets &ldquo;Buchan Haven&rdquo; (overnight) and &ldquo;Heinrich Waenke&rdquo; will be observed by APXS. The DRT is planning to be used. MAHLI will take images of &ldquo;Abernethy,&rdquo; &ldquo;Lochmond Hills,&rdquo; &ldquo;Buchan Haven,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Heinrich Waenke&rdquo; (as close as 1 cm standoff distance). Additionally, there are Mastcam images of &ldquo;Hangingstone Hill&rdquo; (a dark float rock, potentially from the capping unit), &ldquo;Strathy Point&rdquo; (a nodule), &ldquo;White Rashes&rdquo; (local bedrock), and a 15x8 &ldquo;Glen Torridon Mount Sharp Ascent Route&rdquo; mosaic with the M100 camera. Mastcam will also observe &ldquo;Buchan Haven,&rdquo; &ldquo;Crianlarich Hills&rdquo; (2 images), and will take an image of the calibration target. ChemCam will do a combination of long-distance imaging and compositional analyses of targets near the rover. The latter are &ldquo;Hangingstone Hill,&rdquo; &ldquo;Strathy Point,&rdquo; and &ldquo;White Rashes,&rdquo; mentioned above. The long-distance mosaics are &ldquo;Glen Docherty&rdquo; and &ldquo;LD Sulfate 2640a.&rdquo; Navcam will take a dust-devil movie. There is also a DAN active observation, a SAM scrubber activity, a Mastcam full tau, and RAD and REMS get-data activities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The contact-science target &ldquo;Heinrich Waenke&rdquo; honors a late German scientist of that name (1928-2015) who was instrumental in the development of the APXS instrument, which was originally on the Sojourner rover, then was used on MER, and is now on MSL.</p>\r\n", "thumb": "/system/news_items/list_view_images/8583_like-a-dog_320x240px.jpg", "main_image": "/assets/public/missing.png", "status": 1}, {"id": 8582, "title": "Sol 2639: SAM Is Feeling Better", "target": "_self", "main_image_alt": "", "meta_author": "Kenneth Herkenhoff", "byline": "", "meta_keywords": "Mars, mission.

We&rsquo;re in a great position to observe the Gediz Valles deposits (informally named &ldquo;the claw&rdquo;) on top of the Greenheugh Pediment, so the Sol 2638 plan has three more ChemCam RMI mosaics in addition to the two collected over the weekend. The giant science block also allowed us to fit two ChemCam chemistry observations in. One was a follow up observation right next to the vein target Hascosay that was observed on sol 2636. Hascosay had some very interesting chemistry, so the new target &ldquo;Northon&rdquo; will take another look just a few centimeters away. The other ChemCam chemistry target is a small rock named &ldquo;Bruntsfield&rdquo; that looked a bit different than some of the other rocks in the area. Mastcam will document the two chemistry targets and then will collect a 3x1 mosaic of a group of rocks named &ldquo;Clachtoll&rdquo; to study their textures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Amusingly, even though the target names Clachtoll and Bruntsfield were chosen at random from our long list of potential names, we learned that they were very familiar to one of our team members!

Instead, we focused on doing all the remote surface science needed here and catching up on atmospheric monitoring observations after the holidays. Remote sensing observations included ChemCam rasters and Mastcam images of dark float blocks (&ldquo;Shiskine&rdquo; and &ldquo;Lauderdale&rdquo;) and a vein complex (&ldquo;Hascosay&rdquo;), RMI mosaics on Gediz Valles mound materials (&ldquo;Craw Tap&rdquo; and &ldquo;Gowrie&rdquo;), Mastcam multispectral observations of Lauderdale, and Mastcam mosaics of the Western Butte top and the Greenheugh Pediment. We also took a MARDI image to monitor surface changes underneath the rover. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Atmospheric science activities included our regular REMS atmospheric monitoring, RAD radiation monitoring, and DAN passive and active measurements of the subsurface. In the first sol, we also planned a Dust Devil Survey to look for dust-filled convective vortices around local noon, when convection is strong. This was followed by late afternoon activities in the first sol and early morning activities in the third sol, all of which involved making measurements of aerosols (dust or water ice). The two timings were chosen partly so we have some idea how aerosols change with time of sol, but also because imaging early or late in the day is often the best time to find clouds, because relative humidity increases when temperatures cool (provided the amount of water vapor stays the same). In the late afternoon on the first sol, we planned Mastcam measurements of the atmospheric aerosol opacity in the column above us and Mastcam and Navcam measurements of the visibility across the crater. We also planned three cloud observations with Navcam: a Phase Function Sky Survey - a set of images that we use to infer the properties of cloud particles; a Cloud Altitude Observation - movies of clouds and their shadows on Mt. Sharp that, in combination, allow us to infer both the height and speed of the clouds; and a Supra-Horizon movie that looks for clouds over the rim of the crater. Finally, early in the third sol we again measured the column and across-crater opacity with Mastcam, then took Navcam Zenith and Supra-Horizon movies to look for clouds above Mt. Sharp and the crater rim, respectively. Finally, the SAM team decided to repeat an atmospheric observation to measure the methane abundance, and this was performed in the third sol of the plan. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Having &lsquo;un-wheelied&rsquo; in this plan, next week we&rsquo;ll be doing the contact science we missed over the weekend, then heading down the Western Butte again and toward the Greenheugh pediment.</p>\r\n", "thumb": "/system/news_items/list_view_images/8580_doing-a-wheelie_320x240px.jpg", "main_image": "/system/news_items/main_images/8580_doing_a_wheelie.jpg", "status": 1}, {"id": 8579, "title": "Sol 2634: Happy New Year From Mars!", "target": "_self", "main_image_alt": "Curiosity\u2019s workspace at the top of Western Butte for the next few sols.", "meta_author": "Lucy Thompson", "byline": "", "meta_keywords": "Mars, mission, NASA, rover, Curiosity, MRO, ChemCam, SAM, Navcam, REMS", "item_name": "https://mars.nasa.gov/msl-raw-images/proj/msl/redops/ods/surface/sol/02633/opgs/edr/ncam/NLB_631235109EDR_F0781138NCAM00259M_.JPG", "updated_at": "2020-01-02T22:33:45.704Z", "url": "/msl/mission-updates/8579/sol-2634-happy-new-year-from-mars/", "missions": [[175, "mep", "Mars Exploration Program"], [176, "msl", "Mars Science Laboratory"]], "news_type": [[185, "mission_updates", "Mission Updates "]], "description": "The two MRO passes that should have downlinked the data from Curiosity\u2019s New Year activities, to enable planning today, got delayed during processing on the ground.", "date": "January  2, 2020", "body": "<p>The two MRO passes that should have downlinked the data from Curiosity&rsquo;s New Year activities, to enable planning today, got delayed during processing on the ground.

Everyone is excited to be able to continue to investigate the bedrock and float rock at this location, as well as to document the view afforded to Curiosity from this vantage point near the top of Western Butte.</p>\r\n", "thumb": "/system/news_items/list_view_images/8579_happy-ny_320x240px.jpg", "main_image": "/system/news_items/main_images/8579_happy_ny.jpg", "status": 1}, {"id": 8578, "title": "Media Get a Close-Up of NASA's Mars 2020 Rover", "target": "_self", "main_image_alt": "Members of the media interview the builders of the Mars 2020 mission inside JPL's clean room.", "meta_author": "", "byline": "", "meta_keywords": "", "item_name": "", "updated_at": "2019-12-27T22:15:52.812Z", "url": "/news/8578/media-get-a-close-up-of-nasas-mars-2020-rover/", "missions": [[180, "mars2020", "Mars 2020 Rover"], [175, "mep", "Mars Exploration Program"]], "news_type": [[165, "feature", "Feature Stories"]], "description": "The clean room at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory was open to the media to see NASA's next Mars explorer before it leaves for Florida in preparation for a summertime launch.", "date": "December 27, 2019", "body": "<p>Members of the media walked the clean-room floor at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, on Dec. 27 to glimpse the agency's <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/\">Mars 2020 rover</a> and speak with experts working on the mission.

Through the windows of each room's viewing gallery, visitors can watch engineers gowned in white \"bunny suits\" testing Earth-observing satellites and robots built for alien worlds. More than 30,000 members of the public visit High Bay 1 each year, and many also tune in online to <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/mission/where-is-the-rover/\">see the work going on there</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This summer, visitors will be able to see an Earth-science mission called <a href=\"https://nisar.jpl.nasa.gov/\">NISAR</a> being built in High Bay 1. It will be followed by <a href=\"https://europa.nasa.gov/\">Europa Clipper</a>. High Bay 2 will be home to an Earth-science mission called <a href=\"https://swot.jpl.nasa.gov/\">SWOT</a> before a mission to a metal asteroid, <a href=\"https://psyche.asu.edu/\">Psyche</a>, takes its place.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>What's a Clean Room?</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the name implies, a clean room has to be pristine: Dust, hair, oils and other particulates in the air can interfere with electronics and moving parts. All efforts are made to keep bacteria to a minimum as well. Scientists don't want to discover life only to find it was accidentally sent from Earth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"The whole idea of a clean room for spacecraft assembly comes out of the Ranger program,\" Conway said. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>As pathfinders for the Apollo missions that followed, the nine Ranger missions were essentially unarmed missiles fired at the Moon. All but the first two were built in High Bay 1, back when it looked more like an aircraft hangar; engineers even smoked in it. The standards for manufacturing spacecraft were just being established. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sterilizing a spacecraft with heat appeared to fry Ranger 3's electronics, causing it to miss the Moon by 22,000 miles (35,000 kilometers). Debris floating inside Ranger 4 is believed to have led to its failure. Engineers began to realize that specialized clean rooms and cleaning processes were needed to build successful missions.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class='column-width image_module' style=''>\n<figure class='inline_figure'>\n<a href='/resources/24737/mariner-1-in-jpls-spacecraft-assembly-facility/' target='_self'>\n<img alt=\"Mariner 1 in JPL's Spacecraft Assembly Facility\" src='/system/resources/detail_files/24737_PIA23310-16.jpg'>\n</a>\n<figcaption>\n<b>Mariner 1 in JPL's Spacecraft Assembly Facility:</b> JPL's Spacecraft Assembly Facility looks more like a hangar in this photo of two engineers standing with Mariner 1 on May 2, 1962. <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/resources/24737/mariner-1-in-jpls-spacecraft-assembly-facility/\" target=\"_blank\">Full image and caption &rsaquo;</a> \n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>\"When JPL started, we knew more about spacecraft than anybody else &mdash; and we knew nothing,\" said Arden Acord, a systems engineer who began working at JPL in 1971. \"We learned a lot of things along the way.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many of his first coworkers had built <a href=\"https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/jplhistory/early/wartime.php\">the Sergeant and Corporal missiles</a> when JPL was still a U.S. Army lab. Acord was a self-described long-haired hippie working alongside guys with crew cuts: \"It was a tough club to break into for a while. But eventually I became accepted.\" He went on to help build the twin Viking orbiters, which carried the first successful Mars landers, Voyager 1 and 2, and Galileo and Cassini.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Two Rooms for Earth and Beyond</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Almost all the spacecraft Acord worked on were built in High Bay 1, which in 1973 became what's known as a Class 10,000 clean room. That means there are fewer than 10,000 particles of 0.5 microns or larger in size per cubic foot of air volume (0.5 microns is about 200 times smaller than the width of a human hair).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Opened in 1976, High Bay 2 is a Class 10,000 clean room as well. The air in both rooms cycles about 70 times per hour through extensive filtration systems. To keep the workers comfortable, High Bay 2 is kept at 70 degrees, while High Bay 1 is kept at 68 degrees. </p>\r\n\r\n<div class='column-width image_module' style=''>\n<figure class='inline_figure'>\n<a href='/resources/24740/galileo-in-high-bay-1/' target='_blank'>\n<img alt='Galileo in High Bay 1' src='/system/resources/detail_files/24740_PIA23616-16.jpg'>\n</a>\n<figcaption>\n<b>Galileo in High Bay 1: </b>White walls and scaffolding had become a common sight in the High Bay 1 clean room in JPL's Spacecraft Assembly Facility by the time the Galileo orbiter was being built. <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/resources/24740/galileo-in-high-bay-1/\" target=\"_blank\">Full image and caption &rsaquo;</a> \n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Deep space missions tend to be bigger and require more ground equipment, so they typically go in High Bay 1 and involve more gowning for planetary protection purposes. Being the smaller of the pair, High Bay 2 is more suitable for the spacecraft of Earth science missions. The high bays' hangar-door dimensions determine the maximum size of the spacecraft that can be built within.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Keeping It Clean</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of course, filtered air is only part of what makes a clean room clean. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"The level of cleanliness changes depending on the spacecraft you're building,\" said Roger Francis, the building's facility manager. \"If you have special lenses, like a telescope, it requires more effort to make sure particles don't affect your instruments.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But regardless of the type of spacecraft, staff regularly wipe down surfaces with 180-proof isopropyl rubbing alcohol, push microfiber mops across the floors and use HEPA vacuums along wall corners, while the walls themselves are cleaned up to 10 feet (3 meters) high. Most metal is stainless steel, which resists corroding and releasing particles into the air.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then there are the rigorous procedures required for everything that enters the clean room.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p>For spacecraft and their separate components, that means being wrapped in plastic and brought into an airlock outside the clean room. They're unwrapped on the \"dirty side\" of the room and wiped down before being moved to the clean side. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>A crane capable of lifting 30,000 pounds (13,608 kilograms) slides along the ceiling of each room, assisting workers as they move equipment through the high bays. A white parasol on each crane's cable catches any grease or debris from the crane that could land on the sensitive hardware below. </p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Dressing the Part</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>People follow a special process before entering the clean room as well: Automated shoe brushes and sticky mats remove debris from their shoes before they enter a locker room. Once their feet are covered with booties, they step over a line onto the clean side of the room.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then it's time to don a bunny suit, face mask, hair cover and latex gloves before taping sleeves closed. (A mannequin called High Bay Bob stands on the floor of High Bay 1, demonstrating proper attire and giving visitors a sense of scale.) Finally, they step into an \"air shower\" that blows stray particles off the outside of their garments.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class='column-width image_module' style=''>\n<figure class='inline_figure'>\n<a href='/resources/24739/ranger-7-in-safs-high-bay-1/' target='_blank'>\n<img alt='Ranger 7 in High Bay 1 on Dec. 10, 1963' src='/system/resources/detail_files/24739_PIA23520-NASA.jpg'>\n</a>\n<figcaption>\n<b>Ranger 7 in SAF's High Bay 1: </b>High Bay 1 looks more like a modern clean room in this photo of Ranger 7 taken on Dec. 10, 1963, in JPL's Spacecraft Assembly Facility.

As added precautions against static electricity, humidity in the room is kept at about 45% and the concrete floor has a special epoxy coating to bleed static charge that builds up in garments as people move about the room.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>The Wall of Fame</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The mission emblems that line the top of High Bay 1's south wall aren't exempt from the cleanliness requirements. The idea for the placards came about in 2008, when Acord was tasked with preserving the Spacecraft Assembly Facility's history. Representing JPL's biggest missions, the emblems would serve as a testament to engineers' hard work assembling and testing hardware.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Visitors to High Bay 1 may have noticed the south wall is running out of room for additional placards. But there's always more space to explore: Emblems might expand onto the east wall in the future.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>News Media Contacts</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Andrew Good<br />\r\nJet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif.<br />\r\n818-393-2433<br />\r\n<a href=\"mailto:andrew.c.good@jpl.nasa.gov\">andrew.c.good@jpl.nasa.gov</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Alana Johnson<br />\r\nNASA Headquarters, Washington<br />\r\n202-358-1501<br />\r\n<a href=\"mailto:alana.r.johnson@nasa.gov\">alana.r.johnson@nasa.gov</a></p>\r\n", "thumb": "/system/news_items/list_view_images/8575_PIA23519-SAF-unannot-320x240.jpg", "main_image": "/system/news_items/main_images/8575_PIA23519-SAF-annotated_1280wide.jpg", "status": 1}, {"id": 8577, "title": "Sols 2631-2633: Exciting Plans for New Year's Eve", "target": "_self", "main_image_alt": "The slope steepens upward toward the top of Western Butte.

Today, we planned sols 2631-2633, which will be the last 3 martian days before we come back to planning bright and early on January 2, 2020.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We came into planning well prepared to ask for lots of good science. Wednesday's team wanted a number of activities that had to be postponed due to the late arrival of the necessary downlink data. We picked up these activities, including some very nice MAHLI images of the block \"Blackwaterfoot.\" The rover planners put together both a closeup to evaluate the grain size of the rock and a large MAHLI mosaic to look at the geometry of the layers. The textures in Blackwaterfoot are interesting - and so is the chemistry. APXS and ChemCam will analyze the elemental composition of Blackwaterfoot, and ChemCam will target a similar block, \"Clashnessie\" to see how much variation there is among the blocks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We are also interested in the composition of the bedrock, and we planned a DRT and APXS analysis of the target \"Ben Arnaboll.\" Mastcam will image these targets, take a nice stereo image of the butte we're on, image the distant scenery to the north, and take another image of \"Aryshire\" to look for changes over the long holiday break. In addition, we'll do a drive up the slope (see image above) and take a large mosaic of the landscape to the south. This one will complement a similar mosaic we took earlier to give us good stereo information on the rough topography we'll be investigating in the new decade.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In terms of monitoring our environment, we are looking for dust devils and characterizing the dust and scattering in the atmosphere with images of the crater rim, several image suites of the sky, and Mastcam images of the sun. To take a picture of the sun, we use filter 7, which blocks enough of the sunlight that the camera sensor isn't damaged. Filter 7 is Mastcam with sunglasses! We'll also look for clouds, measure the weather conditions with REMS and characterize the subsurface with DAN. Finally, APXS will measure the amount of argon in the atmosphere. It can make this measurement without moving the arm since APXS points directly forward with the arm stowed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>None of the activities in the plan will be executed until December 31st, so they will be Curiosity's New Year's Eve celebration. Luckily, Curiosity's celebration won't keep it from working hard on January 1 and 2 since we have dozens of good observations planned for those days, too. We'll have lots of interesting data to start the new decade!</p>\r\n", "thumb": "/system/news_items/list_view_images/8577_exciting-plans-for-new-years-eve_320x240px.jpg", "main_image": "/system/news_items/main_images/8577_exciting_plans_for_new_years_eve.jpg", "status": 1}], "more": true, "total": 3281, "page": 0, "per_page": 40}
